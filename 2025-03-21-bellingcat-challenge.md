This month's [Bellingcat Open Source Challenge](https://challenge.bellingcat.com/) was based on the [guide]() I wrote a couple of months ago on Multispectral Satellite Imagery. One of the participants wrote a really [detailed writeup](https://www.0ne-nine9.co.uk/blog/bellingcat-osint-challenges-multispectral-viewpoints) of how they solved it, including using the [Multispectral Satellite Imagery Explorer](https://bellingcat-ee.projects.earthengine.app/view/multispectral-satellite-imagery-explorer). Nice!
