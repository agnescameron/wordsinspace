<p>I’ve consistently received excellent teaching evaluations, yet I&#8217;m also well aware that teaching evaluations are an imperfect measure of teaching excellence — and, furthermore, that &#8220;excellence&#8221; itself is often operationalized in problematic ways! Nevertheless, the Likert scales suggest I&#8217;m doing okay. I was also awarded, in 2011, The New School’s Distinguished University Teaching Award. (I was nominated several times, but one can win only once!) Students commonly express appreciation for my <b>organization, knowledge, enthusiasm, and accessibility</b>; for my ability to <b>clearly explain complex texts and topics</b>; for my skill in <b>leading inclusive and engaging discussions</b>; and for the <b>thoroughness, promptness, and helpfulness of my feedback</b>.</p>
<p>I’ll share a few student comments from across the past decade+ of evaluations: A student in my Fall 2012 "Urban Media Archaeology" class described me as “<b>Thorough. Enthusiastic. Open-minded. Challenging. Up-to-date. </b>Shannon really pushes you to do your best. And <strong>you want to do your best because you know that SHE’s doing HER best</strong>.” Many students have referred to a variety of my classes as “the best class [they’ve] taken in the program” – or at institution, or anywhere. A student in my Fall 2013 “Archives, Libraries, and Databases” class wrote: “I feel so lucky to have had Shannon as a teacher. She manages to<b> explain every concept with much clarity</b> and always provides references and <b>examples of creative applications</b> of the various subjects we talk about. She facilitates discussions in an effortless invisible way so <b>almost everyone participates</b> and shares their thoughts. Her <b>feedback on student work is helpful and insightful</b>. We often <b>laugh together</b> in class, how wonderful is that?” A Fall 2016 “Maps as Media” student wrote: “Her interactions with students were <b>helpful and respectful.</b> There were diverse students from different backgrounds, and she was <b>fair with all the students</b> <strong>including international students.</strong> She tried to communicate with people who are not used to this academic domain and <b>considered carefully… each student’s interest</b>.” A Spring 2017 “Urban Intelligence” student said: “Shannon is one of the most amazing professors that I’ve ever met. She is not only <b>clever, but also very organized, helpful, respectful, responsible, and motivating.</b> She is absolutely THE BEST.” I’m particularly heartened by comments I received in Fall 2020, after a full semester on Zoom. One student, echoing many of her classmates, wrote: “[Shannon] sets a <b>respectful, supportive, and generous tone</b> that students pick up on and reflect back to one another. She <b>makes it clear that we can critique out of love and kindness</b>, and that working to be better than we have been (both individually and within our fields and institutions) is a form of care and deep engagement. Shannon <b>works harder and more thoughtfully</b> than any other professor I have taken, and her <b>rigor and high standards for herself</b> inspire students to do incredible, and <b>risk-taking, work.</b> Her <b>feedback is helpful, kind</b>, and above all deeply thoughtful. It feels amazing for someone so brilliant to take the time to really engage with my work, and it truly motivates me to push myself.”</p>
<p>My teaching received a great deal of positive attention from across The New School, where I was regularly invited to give guest lectures in colleagues’ classes, to serve as a guest critic in their studios, and to teach across the university’s divisions (My teaching at Penn, by contrast, seems to be somewhat out of place (?) — and I&#8217;ve even been encouraged to dedicate less time to it.). My courses have also resonated beyond my home institutions — thanks in no small part to my class websites. I’ve been invited to offer master classes and pedagogy workshops from Amsterdam to Seoul. My courses have also drawn a variety of external auditors — from library administrators to celebrated poets to university staff members — who’ve greatly enriched our discussions.</p>
<p>Yet what matters most to me is the longitudinal feedback — the &#8220;outcomes&#8221; that manifest in students&#8217; lives a semester, or a decade, after the final grades are in. The non-compulsory check-in or note of appreciation that pops up in my inbox long after graduation. The classroom rapport that develops, over years, into a collaboration or a friendship. The testimonial shared with the dean. The shout-out on an alumni panel.</p>
<h3>I&#8217;ll share a sample of the informal, non-compulsory comments I&#8217;ve received over the years — through email, through posts on social media, through letters submitted to supervisors and passed along to me — and which, I think, best capture my character as a teacher, advisor, and mentor [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6m4Qo_1iV9dSsQ1BJEQtUkPZ_B2mxN3Qm8qursjOOY/edit?usp=sharing">here&#8217;s the long list, </a>which is itself drawn from a small sample of the correspondence I&#8217;ve saved over the past 20 years]:</h3>
<p>From a 2007 testimonial sent to the dean by a former student and 2006 thesis advisee: “To this day, and as someone who has continued my academic pursuits [in another masters program], <b>I have not encountered a more thoughtful and responsive professor. In fact, it is highly unlikely that I will. </b>Shannon’s prompt responses to my coursework were astoundingly comprehensive and thought-provoking. Her attention to detail included not only the theoretical aspects of the work, but also the scholarly and professional realm as she strove to help students become better writers and understand the <b>various avenues for sharing our work outside of the classroom</b>. Shannon has the highly unusual trait of being <b>both an effective and instructive professor and an extremely intriguing scholar</b>. I often marveled at her ability to fulfill both roles so seemingly effortlessly – though I know that her dedication to working tirelessly is the actual truth. In this respect, her influence as an example was immensely important to me as a nascent scholar.” That same student wrote again, years later, as she wrapped up her thesis in her subsequent graduate program: “<b>Your research and thesis student resources have been extremely helpful. I have even sent them to some of my classmates and they’ve been raving about this magical Shannon Mattern at The New School. </b><b>That you put those resources out into the universe for not only your students and your former students, but for… well, anyone… is so gracious and awesome.</b>”</p>
<p>From a former dean, after a 2013 alumni event: “While many faculty were mentioned by name by the alumni on the panel this evening, <b>YOU were mentioned by nearly every one of them specifically as the faculty member who made a significant impact on their learning / lives while at SMS. </b><b>Your generosity of time, intellectual guidance, and moral support</b> were mentioned more than once. I wish you could have heard it for yourself&#8230;.BUT we have it on tape! So wonderful to hear, so wonderful to work with you in the context of SMS!”</p>
<p>A 2012 email from a former thesis advisee: “<b>All the chatting, advising </b>(during my MA but even more so since),<b> helping me plan my adjunct classes</b> by offering massive lists of references,<b> visiting those classes as a guest critic, </b><b>offering me opportunities to TA and insisting on treating it as “co-teaching,” introducing me to so many other valuable contacts — all of these have made me feel like a colleague and a friend as much as a student</b>, and it has really given me the <b>confidence and support to feel like I can succeed in this path.</b> More than any of my other profs, <b>you always offer such genuine care, concern and support. </b>And that consistent and ongoing support really has helped make my success possible.”</p>
<p>A 2014 email from a former student and thesis advisee who went on to pursue a PhD in Denmark: “As I am trying to make my mind understand that I just left New York and my life there, I want to thank you deeply for having inspired me and stirred changes that have brought me to a completely different place than I was five years ago. Yes, I do have to credit you a lot for this, <b>you kind of opened my eyes.</b> I am confused right now about re-integrating in Copenhagen, but <b>I am forever grateful that I am returning with a completely different toolbox and set of ideas, and capacity to realize them. I would never have dared to pursue all this without you as a role model.</b> So thank you, Shannon.”</p>
<p>A 2022 Twitter message from a 2018 student: “I wrote two pieces in your classes that I felt really proud of, and <b>you gave me such positive and supportive feedback that it really helped me as someone with… a debilitating lack of self-confidence.</b> I have read your articles/book since I graduated…, and I am such a fan of your scholarship. Without being mawkish, <b>your email saying you enjoyed my (illustrated essay) is something I return to when I feel defeated, just because I never really had anyone in my education or career tell me that I had anything worthwhile to say</b><b>.</b> So, [I offer] very sincere thanks…”</p>
<p>From a non-traditional student who took several of my classes between 2005 and 2007: “One of the first things to which I credit Shannon was how <strong>she</strong> <b>helped me transition from the world of business,[ where I worked for 30 years], to that of the humanities. Her enthusiasm for her subjects and the seriousness with which she pursued her vocation</b> was irresistible and infectious, and I began to think in ways I had not in many years. As [an advisor] of my thesis, Shannon made a close reading of my work, and <b>the astuteness of her comments made me a more attentive reader, and more disciplined thinker – in short, a better student</b>. The time and effort she gave me as I wrote and revised and revised again went far beyond anything I expected and probably deserved.”</p>
<p>From a TA who worked with me in our 200-student “Understanding Media Studies” lecture class in 2009: “<b>Shannon is hands down one of the most intelligent, thoughtful, and dedicated Professors that I have worked with in my time at the New School, and indeed, throughout my academic career</b><b>. She is truly vibrant in the classroom and expresses a passion for and mastery of her subject matter. </b>Her course was <b>superbly and meticulously crafted</b> to allow for students to develop essential skills for [graduate study], while at the same time allowing them to come into contact with sophisticated theoretical concepts and ideas…. She was <b>always available to answer any questions or concerns [from her TAs], and expressed a genuine trust in my judgment and input.</b> This only added to the tremendous respect I already had for her as a scholar and teacher.” From another TA in the same semester: “Working under Shannon was the <b>single most important pedagogical experience I have had and has changed the way I think about preparation, organization, and managing a class</b>.”</p>
<p>A 2012 email from an advisee who had just attended his first academic conference, after I’d helped him apply and prepare: “So, before the post-conference swoon wears off I just wanted to write to say thanks for everything &#8211; <b>sharing the call with me and encouraging me to apply and helping me to apply and talking through all that stuff and helping me get in</b> (even if just by association) and I think if you weren&#8217;t there being supportive I would&#8217;ve completely lost my shit :)&#8230; I do feel like <b>all these little achievements are really just the result of absorbing and emulating as much as possible from you and everyone else in our program</b> that I’ve been able to work with. Soo, thanks for <b>being so encouraging and giving me all these opportunities</b> and putting up with all my scattered and disorganized ways of dealing with things <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A 2008 letter from an adjunct online faculty member with whom I worked as her program director: “The long stretch of both the virtual classroom and academic department was successfully breached by Shannon’s adept and unique administrative approach. <b>I could not have maintained this position without her. </b>This innovative pedagogical model <b>requires a strong, supportive, engaged and responsive administrator in the department to connect with the myriad far-flung faculty </b>(including roughly 40 adjuncts scattered across the globe, plus 20 full-time faculty). Shannon fulfilled those requirements beyond any I have encountered as an adjunct, whether onsite or online.</p>
<p>A 2021 message from a scholar in Bangkok: “I’m writing you from Bangkok, Thailand, to express my appreciation and support for your work, and, more importantly, your work ethic… <b>Your class contents and references </b>prioritizing polarizing arrays of people, places, and priorities <b>are empowering. I just wanted to let you know that there are people who are moved by what you do. I get excited looking at your course [websites].</b> They are truly motivating.”</p>
<p>An email from an undergraduate student in my 2021 graduate “Design Ethnography Workshop” class: “<b>I felt a bit intimidated at first being one of the few undergrads there, and since I&#8217;ve never taken a 4000 level class before, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect.</b> I&#8217;m happy to hear that my teammates appreciated my contributions to our report, and thank you for all of your help along the way! <b>I&#8217;ve gained so much from this class, and it&#8217;s been one of my favorite anthropology classes I&#8217;ve taken so far!</b> I loved all of the collaborative work, and I hope there are more classes like this in the future! <b>Thank you for being such an amazing professor as always</b>!” From a graduate student in the class: “Now that [you have submitted grades] I can speak more freely to say that <b>you are a truly extraordinary teacher</b>&#8230;. Many professors seem more engaged in their research and other projects, which they probably have to due to pressures to make a name for themselves&#8230; I know that you do that and probably much more but <b>you still prioritize teaching. To us students, that makes all the difference. I have also heard many good things about you in [my home] department</b>, so you may be getting more of us in the future :)” An email from another graduate student: “I just wanted to tell you that <b>you are doing an amazing job with this course that you designed for us. It is impressive to see how you organize the information, the materials for each session, and how, every Thursday, everything progresses and makes sense. This happens because you manage to articulate our ideas with yours in an admirable way, </b><b>you give shape to this experiment, making us feel like we are going to a good place</b> in the midst of uncertainty.” And from another student: “Thank you so much for the feedback. Before I respond, <b>I just wanted to acknowledge how exceptional I&#8217;ve found your thoughtful approach to planning and executing this course. </b><b>You seem to truly care about our learning, ability to access course materials and one another, our understanding of the purpose and goals of each session, and the outcomes we hope to achieve as individual learners. I&#8217;ve rarely experienced a professor so profoundly caring and am consistently amazed by your availability</b> over email and the efficiency with which you operate. You are an amazing teacher and I am really enjoying this course :)”</p>
<p>A 2022 Twitter message from an academic librarian: “It’s really meant a lot to me meeting you on here. <b>Your kindness and encouragement to young scholars and those outside of traditional structures is very widely known and appreciated</b>.”</p>
<p>A 2023 email from a New School graduate student who completed her dissertation before I joined the Anthropology department, and thus before I had an opportunity to meet her: “<b>As people no doubt tell you all the time, your twitter is an absolute beacon in an otherwise very murky, overwhelming academic world (and world).</b> You posted the advertisement for the position at Colby College, which was the first job description I ever read that I thought I was perhaps remotely viable for. I applied, got the campus interview, gave the job talk…. <b>Thank you for the tremendous generosity of your public presence and the efforts you make to distribute resources and opportunities</b>.”</p>
<p>A student from my 2022 “Redesigning the Academy” class, the last class I taught at The New School, emailed me to say: “This class was an<b> absolute highlight of my Parsons experience and it is exactly what I needed to help keep my motivation up and to help try to make things better</b> — continuously.” Another wrote: “<b>I&#8217;ve learned so much from you, through the course materials and through your pedagogy. I only wish one day I could be as good a teacher as you</b> are to my students to match up with your <b>incredible work ethic </b>and your invaluable contributions, not only to the field of humanities and social sciences but <b>to this higher education system as a whole</b>. You are <b>truly a role model for everyone here at TNS. I know it&#8217;s not just me but this is a strong feeling shared by every student who comes into contact with you</b>.” Another student from the same class wrote: “I wanted to thank you for <b>being a great professor and designing and teaching such interesting classes.</b> Starting from the latter: the <b>reflexive and nuanced way your classes manage the tensions that emerge when intersecting different disciplines</b>&#8230; is really something that I benefited from, helping me (someone [with] a background in finance&#8230; who is doing a MA in anthropology) to explore both the disciplinary blind spots as well as the sometimes conflicting and sometimes extremely generative possibilities of synergy. Now from the former: I think that <b>the level of care and attentiveness you put into your classes and into our (students) particular learning processes is unrivaled</b> probably in the whole NSSR. It is really something that touches us. TNS has clearly lost a lot with your departure. It was a pleasure being your student for the past year.” Another shared via email: “<b>It is a rare experience, I have found, to encounter a professor like you.</b> I am very thankful to be in your class this semester and to have you as my advisor.”</p>
<p>After I left The New School, in 2022, a PhD student at the New School for Social Research — someone with whom I hadn’t interacted during my time at TNS — wrote me to say: “Since this is my first opportunity in my correspondence with you, let me just start by saying thank you. For two very particular reasons: (one) <b>Your website is a goldmine</b>; it inspired and continues to inspire not only me and my work but arguably and more importantly, my pedagogical approach. Ever since being introduced to it, <b>I have borrowed ways of teaching, reorienting my slides to be simpler and more graphical, implemented stuff like &#8220;alternate forms of participation&#8221;</b> in all my classes and alongside an &#8220;ecology of knowledge&#8221; approach (Katherine Hayles), I believe (and hope) it serves my students well. (two) <b>your body of work opened up my imaginary</b> as to what kinds of rigorous and yet pertinent and accessible scholarships were possible. Again, <b>this bleeds into my own teaching; I teach your articles</b> on &#8220;Maintenance and Care&#8221; and &#8220;The Spectacle of Data&#8221; as important elements in my Open Source Software class, for example&#8230; The above is all true but I would be lying if I insisted that this email was ALL precipitated on the back of pure altruism and solidarity. It has a selfish component which I am coming to. Outside of your own scholarship, <b>I also heard of fantastic things from colleagues who were in your classes and were mentored by you</b>, and I guess my disappointment is that I was unable to associate with you.”</p>
<p>A 2024 email from a New School graduate and a current doctoral student at another institution: “I admire your work and always find incredible inspiration in reading and learning from you. <b>Although I never took a class with you—something I always regret—I remember your comments when you attended the exhibitions and student sessions at the [Transdisciplinary Design] program at Parsons.</b> Today, I am writing my dissertation [and serving as a lecturer at MIT]. I have to say <b>I have learned a lot from your syllabus and pedagogy. </b>I am hopefully honoring your legacy on maps and other media.  …I just wanted to say hello and say <b>you are a genuine model of the kind of professor and academic I will always aspire to be. </b>With no other further thing to say: thank you.”</p>
<p>A very quiet student from my 2023 &#8220;Cinema and Media Studies Methods&#8221; class — the first class I taught at Penn — wrote me after the semester to say: &#8220;<b>I liked that everyone was being supportive, friendly, and open to opinions</b>, and <b>I felt safe expressing myself, to exchanging intellectual ideas</b>; this is something that I have missed from school, <b>to express yourself even if you may be wrong</b> is something less common when I stepped out of school, in[to] the “real world.’ I appreciate <b>how engaging the class was</b>, the field trips, the guests, and the informal dinner with the professors. I also appreciated <b>how responsive you were and the detailed feedback you provided</b>, and that you have <b>constantly asked for feedback from us. </b>Not trying to defame anyone here, but this is in contrast to many of my personal experiences: a lot of professors don’t reply to emails, barely grade assignments on time, and provide almost no feedback until the end of the semester.” Still another student wrote: “This semester has been a <b>fantastic journey of learning from you. I had no idea an academic &#8220;methods class&#8221; could be so engaging.</b> I&#8217;ve learned a lot of new ideas about how to think about methods and approach them, which is fantastic!” And yet another said: “Thank you so much for your very <b>thoughtful and detailed feedback!</b> I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for a wonderful semester. I really appreciated the time and effort that went into tailoring topics to our interests and providing <b>multiple opportunities for great feedback</b>.”</p>
<h3>In Summer 2024, as I prepared a teaching and mentoring dossier for some new public pedagogy projects, I created a web form where anyone who&#8217;d engaged with and somehow benefited from my teaching or teaching materials could share their thoughts. Here&#8217;s what some folks — students, dissertation advisees, postdocs, long-term faculty and staff colleagues, acquaintances, strangers — said:</h3>
<p>Comments from a 2020-2021 teaching assistant, advisee, and article co-author: “Shannon’s contributions as a scholar, educator, and mentor are profound. <b>As her TA for two semesters, I saw up close the care and creativity she puts into preparing her classes and how that translates into an unparalleled student experience</b> — one that both <b>directly responds to the interests and experiences of students</b> and also provides <b>outlets to explore, write, and experiment capaciously through generative assignments and moments for substantive feedback from both Shannon and other classmates</b>. I regularly find myself<b> referring back to her thoroughly researched open syllabi for the classes I TA’ed (and also those I did not!)</b> when looking for readings, links to digital projects, assignments, or inspiration for a topic I’m working on. <b>Finding yourself in a “Shannon class” typically meant sitting next to students from a dozen majors</b> and the semester was a masterclass in <b>developing strategies for communicating across and bridging different disciplines.</b> Her classes are as much a<b> collective journey for all involved</b>, with Shannon serving as a generous guide and approachable resource, rather than a “sage on a stage.&#8221; Both Shannon’s work and Shannon herself are [respected] by scholars, artists, and professionals working across the fields of media studies, architecture, art history, urban planning, and library and information science, demonstrated most notably by the<b> enthusiastic guest speakers who accepted her invitations and brought new perspectives to our class experience.</b> In short: <b>taking a class with Shannon is an example of the best of what higher education can be, largely because she models so many of the practices that make a learning environment generative, welcoming, and motivating</b>.”</p>
<p>Comments from a long-term New School colleague: “Dr. Mattern&#8217;s<b> innovative pedagogy has been a model and inspiration to me and to so many of my colleagues across an expansive disciplinary range</b> &#8211; from studio arts to media studies to anthropology, information studies, cultural studies, design, and more. Her critically informed and <b>reflective approach to sharing and principled advocacy for open access</b> to knowledge has served as an ethical compass for my own teaching practice.”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2021 student: “As graduate student at TNS outside of the Anthropology Department who originally signed up for the class as an “interesting elective,” the Anthro &amp; Design Course was <b>one of the most impactful and insightful times</b> in my studies. In an extremely difficult and isolating year in academia [amidst] COVID and remote learning,<b> your intentionality in creating a community agreement and fostering a welcoming environment, even through screens, </b>produced such wonderful, respectful, and brilliant student relationships and feedback loops. I specifically <b>appreciate your organization and time spent laying out class materials</b> and student work on your website. The course topics and <b>time spent workshopping materials with your editing</b> completely <b>shifted my approach to my thesis and re-inspired my writing</b>, support I was missing from my own department. I gleaned so much from your lectures as well as your mentorship via the work and presentation of my fellow classmates. Not only on the literal course material and fascinating relationships between anthropology and design, but a larger learning of effective pedagogy via class activities that has <b>heavily influenced my approach to my upcoming first time teaching adjunct</b> media studies.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, thesis advisee, and current faculty at another institution: “Shannon is an incredibly generative and engaged teacher and advisor.<b> The depth (and pedagogical transparency!) of her syllabi is something that I have sought to practice myself</b> (I am nowhere near Shannon&#8217;s level in this!) &#8230; During my time at the New School, our classes regularly <b>found ourselves outside the classroom… as we looked at how learning happens in the world</b>, which was a meaningful and powerful gesture at bridging between academia and public engagement. As a thesis advisor, she was patient, supportive, and a generously thorough reader. I think that <b>part of Shannon’s unique talent is how synthetic her writing i</b>s (this is why there are always Shannon Mattern texts on my syllabi). She is a<b> prolific looker / gatherer / reader / question-asker</b> and brings together a wide array of ideas, objects, buildings, artworks, and other examples &#8230; and weaves them into incredibly thoughtful and accessible texts. All of this has been extremely meaningful for my own approach to writing, teaching, and interdisciplinary inquiry!”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2020-21 student: “Shannon’s guidance as a mentor is (and has consistently been) purely and wonderfully generative! Her ability to <b>inspire question-asking, horizon-broadening, and micro-cum-macro-seeing</b> made my work during grad school — and certainly the way I approach community engagement, research, and design now that I’ve graduated — more self-assured and inclusive. Anymore, <b>the way I ask questions (of an idea, a challenge, a person) has shifted in that an answer may no longer just be means to an end but another opportunity to learn</b>, another chance to explore information. <b>I have never felt so encouraged by a professor or teacher — Shannon&#8217;s curiosity and excitement for learning</b> are contagious and I’m a better designer and advocate because of her impact.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student (2011-12) and capstone advisee: “Shannon Mattern’s skills and impact as a teacher and advisor are truly remarkable. She’s incredibly <b>hands-on, making sure every student feels engaged and supported.</b> Her enthusiasm for the subject and passion for teaching create a classroom environment that’s both inspiring and motivating. Shannon’s <b>strong work ethic and deep knowledge</b> make her a standout educator who really cares about her students’ learning. <b>Even years after taking her classes, I still remember how much I enjoyed them.</b> <b>She’s not just a great teacher but also someone who builds lasting, personal connections with her students, </b>making a big impact both in the short term and long after the class is over.”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2012-13 postdoctoral advisee: “<b>I&#8217;m 43 years old. I&#8217;ve gained two PhDs, held more than fifty university courses, published several books,</b> and developed extensive digital projects. I’m mentioning this to emphasize that I’ve quite some experience in the academic world. In this journey, <b>Shannon was my most important teacher. </b><b>She taught me new ways of doing media studies, of conceptualizing digital projects, and of combining state-of-the art research with teaching.</b> Apart from being an <b>inspiring scholar and teacher</b>, she is also an exemplary <b>humble and lovable person</b> whom I&#8217;m proud to call a friend. The only critical thing that I can say about her is that she works too much, actually so much that the rest of us look lazy next to her <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2023 student and university librarian: <b>&#8220;The way I think about and practice reading, writing, research methods, the structure of my consultations, the communication of my transdisciplinary work, and the estimation of the value of my work has fundamentally been rewired </b>by my interactions with Shannon. She has a unique way of <b>making sense of structures in flux and extending her empathy in tangible ways. </b>The sense of <b>solidarity and camaraderie that I personally feel with her as a queer woman of colour international scholar </b>in the alternative academy is something I truly cherish. Thank you Shannon!”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and co-instructor: “Shannon’s <b>commitment to expansive, critical, meaningful, rigorous, and joyful pedagogy</b> is an inspiration. Shannon <b>teaches in multiple modalities</b>, each one beautifully thought out and researched. Each week in her syllabi includes a long list of supplemental material for anyone wishing to dig deeper into a subject. She provides <b>material from multiple disciplines and cultures of knowledge</b> in a variety of media. She assigns <b>projects that invite creativity, fun, research, and integration of personal knowledge, experience, and curiosity</b>. In the classroom, Shannon <b>holds a caring space,</b> where she fosters a <b>group culture of mutual support and excitement</b> around not only the subject matter, but people&#8217;s individual interests and work as well. She is <b>always prepared, has a wealth of references and knowledge both contemporary and historical, and facilitates discussions with great energy and ease.</b> In all of the classes that I took with her, Shannon had <b>organized field trips that strengthened my connection to knowledge preservation,</b> knowledge production, and cultural production in New York City. Shannon is <b>proof that incredible and important work can take plan across disciplines</b>, both in academia and outside of it. Shannon is<b> one of the most impactful educators I have ever met. </b>I draw on her practice, experience, and wisdom every time I teach, learn, write, or make art.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and research assistant: “Without exaggeration,<b> you remain my north star in terms of pedagogy and public scholarship,</b> and I owe *so much* to your support over the past several years. Though my ‘unorthodox’ and meandering path into academia/research often <b>left me vulnerable to imposter syndrome in graduate school, your attentive guidance and constructive feedback</b> during that time always made me feel like my efforts and contributions as an RA/student were meaningful. Your intellectual and personal generosity gave me <b>confidence to pursue opportunitie</b>s I may not have otherwise felt qualified for—and I know for a fact that <b>your co-sign has impacted other peoples’ decisions to take a chance on me.</b> I could truly write many more words about your impact on my career and general disposition toward research and education (and would be happy to, if it’s useful!), but for the sake of brevity here, I can conclude by maintaining that you are a <b>brilliant scholar and an incredibly kind person</b>, and that (rare) combination of qualities comes across so clearly in your teaching, advising and research/writing.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, dissertation advisee, research advisee, and co-author: &#8220;I have learned and gained so much from my work with Shannon. <b>Her classes were incredibly informative and engaging</b>, but beyond Shannon’s mentorship during the PhD application process and in the early stages of my PhD <b>made me more confident as a scholar.</b> I have also always deeply appreciated her <b>generosity to her students.</b> <b>As her RA, she brought me into her research, </b><b>taking me with her to interviews and making me feel like a collaborator.</b> <b>We later did write a piece together</b> (with the incredible Emily Bowe). <b>Shannon is one of few professors I’ve had who welcomed my input as a student on equal footing</b>, and who invited me (and others) into projects and publishing.</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, teaching assistant, and web designer: “Reflecting on my two years of graduate studies at The New School and my years as a service designer for the government, several people have significantly influenced my growth as a practitioner, teacher, and individual. Among them, Shannon stands out. First, <b>Shannon’s impact extended beyond her own programs.</b> She <b>actively contributed as a guest speaker, advisor, and collaborator across various New School programs.</b> Her efforts to bridge disciplines and overcome silos have inspired me to adopt a <b>similar approach in my work with the federal government</b>, where I strive to break down bureaucratic barriers to effect meaningful change. Second, <b>Shannon fostered learning environments that nurtured </b><b>curiosity, collaboration, and genuine learning.</b> Her courses were relevant and engaging, <b>encouraging diverse perspectives and innovative combinations of methodologies and theories.</b> I aim to emulate Shannon’s teaching style and ability to craft these engaging learning environments in my work, creating environments that promote learning and curiosity while working towards shared goals. Finally,<b> Shannon exemplifies values I aspire to embody. She brings joy to those around her, appreciates diverse perspectives and strengths, supports everyone in their work, is optimistic about the future, and is always open to learn new ways of looking at the world.</b> I am incredibly fortunate to have her as a mentor, teacher, friend!”</p>
<p>Comments from a literature faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>Your teaching has truly opened up new vistas for me</b> &#8211; <b>the way you </b><b>model pedagogy that is interdisciplinary and capacious</b><b>, your ability to design assignments that are creative and rigorous, and your </b><b>modeling of talking about teaching in public</b> have really impacted my own pedagogy. I also have <b>a colleague who was inspired by your local media class to develop a similar class situated in her own geographical and institutional context</b>.”</p>
<p>Comments from a design faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>I incorporate material Shannon’s generously shared and meticulously curated and annotated </b><b>open-access resources</b> – in particular the Are.na collections “Manuals+Guides,” “Sensory Maps” and “Redaction Aesthetics,” but many others – in my undergraduate and Honours level teaching in the Visual Communication program at the University of Technology Sydney. In addition, <b>I use Shannon as a example of the kind of scholar I&#8217;d like my Higher Degree Students (PhD and MA in Design) to become</b> – many students come into academia from a professional creative practice, and have concerns about dedicating much of their time writing for publications that are inaccessible to practice, by journal pay-walls and books with extremely high price-points. <b>Shannon&#8217;s open access, inclusive approach to sharing her scholarship and pedagogy is an inspiration</b> to these students, and myself and colleagues in the field of Design research.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and dissertation advisee: “The course I took with Shannon as a PhD student was an important intellectual experience for me, but the biggest long-term impact of the course was the way it <b>opened up what university teaching could look like</b>. As I’ve subsequently gone on to design and teach undergraduate courses myself, I have drawn heavily on many, many things I observed in that one semester: <b>ways of facilitating authentic connections between students, ways of structuring classroom time, ways of sharing and using external resources effectively; ways of drawing everyone’s voice into the discussion, ways of balancing critique and constructive engagement.</b> <b>The care and intention put into that course’s design was miles above the baseline </b>I had come to expect, and it inspired me to get excited about my own teaching in new ways. Through teaching and advising,<b> she is also always seeding new networks of collaborators, intuitively sensing which people and organizations would want to know about or be exposed to which other people or organizations</b>. Several times in the past five years of knowing and working with her,<b> she has suggested a contact, reference, or interlocutor </b>who was exactly who I needed to know about at a given moment in time. This has been great for me individually, but also <b>bespeaks a deep commitment to understanding the place of her teaching in the arc of students’ learning, and to furthering conversations between different academic fields, industry, and public service work. </b></p>
<p>Comments from a 2021-22 student: “I had followed your writing and open course materials for years before finally getting the opportunity to study with you. When I did, I was surprised and <b>happy to learn that you bring the same care, brilliance, omnivorousness, and capaciousness to your teaching. Through course materials and one-on-one discussions, you introduced me to ideas, artworks, and texts that brought depth and rigor to my own research and artwork</b>, and continue to influence me strongly. You encouraged me to pursue hybrid, interdisciplinary work that I struggled to find a home for. <b>As I started my own teaching career, I&#8217;ve been especially inspired by the way you center kindness, common sense, and acting ethically and equitably in everything you do,</b> from your scholarship and syllabi to the way you conduct your classes. Thank you for everything!!”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2014-18 dissertation advisee: “<b>It’s impossible to overstate Shannon’s skills as a thinker, mentor, and educator. She is a true interdisciplinarian</b>, able to think across fields and draw together resonant constellations of thinkers, artists, professionals around topics both urgent and unexpected (library design and services, repairs manuals, PowerPoint), always with the <b>goal to draw attention to the ways we have collective agency and creative capacity to make and remake our world.</b> Working with Shannon — <b>her consistent, thoughtful, and generous responses to my own ideas; her brilliant edits of my writing; and her example as a scholar and teacher — has made me a more generous thinker, a more active citizen, and a more engaged teacher.&#8221;<br />
</b></p>
<p>Comments from a 2019-21 student: “I can confidently say that Shannon Mattern is the<b> role model anyone would be fortunate to meet.</b> She consistently<b> upheld her standards and fought for what she believed in</b>, all while creating a <b>professional, supportive, and caring environment in academia</b>. She wasn’t just committed to our school but was deeply engaged with various collaborative projects and communities within her wider circle. I watched her with admiration as she excelled in her element. Often, <b>I found myself thinking, ‘If I ever become a teacher, researcher, or mentor, I want to be like her.</b>’ <b>Shannon treated us as colleagues rather than students.</b> She generously shared her personal library whenever we needed additional resources, and <b>through her vast network, we had the opportunity to connect with brilliant and creative researchers from all around the world&#8230;. </b>Her <b>transparency and fairness </b>provided invaluable insight into the realities of our field and helped me understand the expectations for success. But beyond being an academic mentor, Shannon was also a friend —<b> always there to listen, offering us space and security during one of the most uncertain times in recent history</b>. I only wish I could sit with her again for one of our conversations, to witness her excitement for her next project. I feel truly lucky and honored to have worked with, and befriended, Shannon Mattern.”</p>
<p>Comments from from a faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>You have generously shared your pedagogical approaches and resources online and they have helped many of us see creative and interesting possibilities</b> of pedagogy that are rooted in care, <b>not just for students but for the world and the things that make this world lovely.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Comments from a public librarian: “Your approach to interdisciplinary public scholarship has <b>helped me see a path for academic thought that’s truly driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to share ideas</b>. It feels like that should be a given, but it’s really not, and I find it exciting enough I always click through to any new project you’re working on, class website you share, etc. I work in public libraries and that’s how I came to your work. <b>I’ve really benefitted from the way you talk about teaching and look for ways to encourage curiosity and collaboration in your classrooms. I&#8217;ve specifically paid attention to the cultivation of a vibe</b>, setting of expectations, structure of assignments, and shaping the experience through care in materials’ design &amp; aesthetics. Absorbing that over several years has definitely <b>influenced the way I run small seminar/workshop-style programs for adults at my library.</b> I want them engaged, curious, and making connections between ideas, and thinking about educators/creators/etc. who evoke that in me is always my starting point. Given the difference in setting &amp; duration of my time w/ attendees I’m not incorporating specific exercises or readings or assignments, <b>I’m looking more at the way you talk about the class as a living and dynamic entity, the kinds of questions you ask, the space you create for them to make something, and the balance you strike between flexibility &amp; rigor.</b> In a reference context, <b>I’ve also referred potential and current grad students in interdisciplinary fields to your work. </b>Even when their fields were some distance from your own, I’d pulled together a few articles &amp; class websites I felt really underscored that it’s possible to develop a voice strong enough to cut through disciplinary enclosures. Given my lack of access to an academic library &amp; the fact that at least one of these patrons was not yet affiliated either, <b>the public facet of your writing and teaching has been essential to my ability to access it &amp; connect others.</b> I am so grateful, and the people I&#8217;ve shared it with have been as well.&#8221;</p>

I try to see everything he shares in New York, and back when I used to blog about all my art excursions, I documented a <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2013/09/22/maps-markings-another-art-roundup-harriet-bart-william-kentridge-nathan-carter-barry-mcgee-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few of</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2014/02/02/aesthetic-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2015/11/29/letters-landscapes-textures-topographies-i-saw-more-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a>. Now, as I enjoy his brilliant <a href="https://mubi.com/en/cast/william-kentridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Self Portrait as a Coffee Pot </em>series</a> on Mubi, I&#8217;m reminded that I had hoped to include a section on his work in <a href="https://transmediale.de/en/media/redaction-disappearing-data-from-nano-to-stratospere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my transmediale talk</a> and <a href="https://www.librarystack.org/reparative-redaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibraryStack booklet</a> about reparative redaction, but we had to cut it — primarily because of copyright restrictions. So, I figured I&#8217;d share that redacted (or, rather, deleted) passage on Kentridge&#8217;s redaction, which draws heavily on Leora Ruth Maltz&#8217;s work, here:</p>

<p>&#8230;Relatedly, South African artist William Kentridge regards his method and medium of erasure as a metaphor for apartheid’s censorship and forced removals, its "fantasies of origins and purity" – and for the nation’s habitual avoidance or “whiting out” of these difficult truths.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a> Yet his chosen drawing medium, charcoal, resists total erasure. It, like Ligon’s oil stick, inevitably leaves a smudge. For Kentridge, that smudge is liberating, perhaps even healing – both for himself and for the fraught legacies he depicts in his work. As art historian Leora Ruth Maltz explains, the smudge’s provisionality “stav[es] off the disabling possibility of perfectionism” and precludes the drawing’s permanence.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> It also signals the “impossibility of a mythic return to origins” and frames erasure – on both paper and land – as futile.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a></p>
<p>Kentridge’s process is a sort of historiographic and geological <em>sous rature</em>. In his Colonial Landscapes series, he aims to “signal the palimpsestic nature of land, to gesture to its ‘hidden’ histories” via red marks that he calls “beacons against forgetting,” which are layered atop the charcoal drawings,” crossing them out, “simultaneously augmenting, qualifying and denying the mark beneath.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a> Again, we see the entanglement of annotation and redaction. Kentridge’s visible deletions “function as gestures of critical distance,” producing what Maltz calls an “epistemology of doubt,” a “radical and productive conviction of uncertainty.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a> These scars link the topography of the page to the South African landscape, suggesting the reparative potential of envisioning the nation as a palimpsest, a smudge, rather than a clean separation of white and black.</p>
<p>Stencils and maps. Wax and denim and charcoal. Paper and canvas and papyrus. Redaction artists’ material reflexivity extends not only to the nature of their mark-making media and substrates, but also to the genres and formats those substrates are molded into&#8230;</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Over three years ago, in the summer of 2021, I was asked to submit a chapter to an edited volume that would expand upon an artist collective&#8217;s body of work; they had been engaged in exciting social practice that explored &#8220;the enactment of laws on public surfaces.&#8221; At that time I was thinking a lot about trees: I spent much of the first pandemic year among the trees ringing Manhattan. Those arboreal affiliations shaped the intro and conclusion to <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208053/a-city-is-not-a-computer?srsltid=AfmBOoqOpjy373W-sthSZ4yCCRCLcnDfjazKhBMr-5O--fuqJc9CW7GI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 2021 book</a>, which focused on &#8220;arboreal intelligence&#8221; — which, in turn, inspired a Fall 2021 article, &#8220;<a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/tree-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tree Thinking</a>,&#8221; that examined how trees have historically served as foundational conceptual models.</p>
<p>So, for the edited collection, I wrote about tree law. I did a couple weeks of research and submitted what I thought was a solid, substantial essay. The book would ostensibly be published by an admirable small art press — I own dozens of their books — just a few months later. But we then learned that the project was delayed a few months. Then another few months. Then a year. Then I stopped hearing from the editors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now accepted that that book is never coming to fruition, and I don&#8217;t feel like pitching my essay to other venues. So, I&#8217;ll share it here. I&#8217;ll also note a few relevant incidents that occurred since I wrote the piece: first, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188752528/universal-studios-might-have-invoked-the-wrath-of-californias-tree-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2023 controversy</a> over Universal Studios&#8217; decision to trim their street trees at precisely the same time striking SAG-AFTRA remembers relied on those trees for shade — an incident that sparked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/why-does-the-internet-love-tree-law-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much Internet fascination with tree law</a>; second, the revelation that a man in New Jersey had <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/authorities-say-nj-homeowner-cut-down-32-of-neighbors-trees-the-cost-could-be-huge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut down a few dozen of his neighbor&#8217;s trees</a> to enhance his own views of the sunrise over New York City; and third, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/nyregion/tree-law-mamaroneck-westchester-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this past summer&#8217;s controversy</a> over new tree removal policies in Westchester County.</p>

<h1>Arboreal Codes</h1>
<h3>Trees as Legal and Social Bodies</h3>
<p>Before one could head down to the local assessor’s or county records office, examine a deed, or review a plat to ascertain the boundaries of their own property, they might have instead consulted the trees. Red maples and boxwoods and white pines commonly served as substrates for the codification of territorial claims. Until 1886, surveyors in New South Wales, Australia, were required to use trees to mark the corners of a piece of property. They’d find an appropriately sturdy specimen; cut a blaze into its trunk, exposing the solid wood beneath; then carve in the number of the owner’s allotment.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> If the corner of a plot was signaled with some other object, like a rock or an iron post, surveyors – then and even now – would sometimes use nearby trees to "witness," or point toward, the corner, or to trace the line between those corners. They’d chop a series of horizontal lines into the border trees’ trunks, and those scars would brand the property boundaries for decades to come.</p>

<p>Paint and colored plastic ribbon, or “flagging,” can also serve as less invasive, but also less permanent, arboreal markings. In a timber forest, where the trees themselves are meant to be ephemeral, colored paint and ribbon codes – which vary from region to region, and from timber company to timber company – can flag those trees destined for felling or those spared such a fate, aid in record-keeping for forest inventories, or signal ownership. While forestry organizations have long sought to set standards for such arboreal codes, forester Steve Nix explains, his lot “are an independent breed,” and “many see their tree marking designs and system as their personal or company imprint or brand.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Those marks etched or chopped into bark signaled the identity of those who staked a claim to the tree and the land on which it stood – and, consequently, established social and legal relations between the individuals or parties on either side of the dendrological divide.</p>
<p>As Estonia fell under the control of the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Poles between the 13<sup>th</sup> and 16th centuries, those spatial divides shifted, and the colonizing forces mandated more regimented means of demarcating boundaries. Feudal contracts in the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries and maps from the 17<sup>th</sup> century commonly identified both standing and fallen trees and stumps of all species – oaks, birches, spruces, pines, aspens, and alders – as boundary markers. In the field, those trees were often marked themselves, with stripes or notches, with the bishop’s crozier and lily, or with crosses. When, in the late 17the century, Swedish authorities mandated that landed property boundaries be marked with less morphologically variable emblems, like stones or charcoal pits, the use of boundary trees fell out of favor – yet the cross persisted as an arboreal inscription, now with a new commemorative and spiritual function. Trees had long been central to Estonian folklore, as historian Ülle Tarkianinen explains.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> And starting in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, mourners began cutting crosses into trees as they traveled to burial sites; those marks were meant both to memorialize the dead and to keep them from coming back to haunt the living.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> “In both cases the tree with a cross denoted crossing a kind of boundary,&#8221; Tarkianinen argues: “in the first case, the boundary between earthly possessions, in the second, the boundary between life and death.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>

<p>As these historical and contemporary examples make clear, trees have served as more than mere substrates for legal codification of property. Their markings have also served in accounting and commemoration. Yet those inscriptions aren’t the only means by which trees constitute legal declarations. Through their stature, species, and position, trees also serve as arboreal embodiments of socio-spatial codes. Arthur D. Peterson writes that, in Iowa in the 19<sup>th</sup> century – and likely in other settler colonial territories – the “regular taking of timber could satisfy the requirements of continuous, actual, open and notorious possession necessary to establish title” to a land; in other words, by regularly and openly harvesting trees, one was eventually entitled to claim ownership of that land.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Around the same time, in pre-colonial Kenya, trees often served as boundary markers in customary land tenure practices, which prioritized communal stewardship by <em>mbari</em>, or sub-clans, and distinguished between rights to control land, on the one hand, and rights to use and access it, on the other.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a> Mugumo, “a widely recognized and fast-growing tree with magical qualities,” was commonly used to mark boundaries between clans’ land holdings. The species was not allowed to propagate on its own; only specimens planted intentionally were permitted to grow to maturity. Their presence thus “indicated something of importance such as a githaka (a sub-clan estate) boundary or a ceremonial site.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a> Other species – mwatha, muiri, mukawa, muringa – were also useful in marking boundaries “because they could be easily recognized, because they were easily propagated… and because they had some utility or medicinal value.”</p>
<p>In 1929, after the arrival of British colonizers, the Committee on Land Tenure in Kikuyu Province recommended that only mugumo trees and itoka lilies be used as boundary markers, and that it be made unlawful to plant these species in lines anywhere <em>aside</em> from a boundary. Chief Native Commissioner G. V. Maxwell laid out these recommendations in a set of draft rules, which were never implemented, most likely, forest advisor Peter Dewees proposes, “because they would have legitimized some sort of customary system of private tenure – a notion which the colonial government strongly resisted.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> Validating customary arboreal symbols would have challenged the force of colonial rule. The Registered Land Act of 1963 purported to extinguish rights under customary law and to consolidate the rights of control, access, and use in the landowner. This legislation, Dewees argues, profoundly affected women and the landless, who, under customary law, would have had the right to access and use trees, but lost those rights when they passed to private landowners, typically privileged men.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a> Trees thus came to signal restricted human access to and use of land, as well as use of their arboreal kin within those boundaries. Yet Dewees reports that, in more recent years, state land administration has effectively abandoned the 1963 act and returned to customary distinctions between ownership of the land and of the things growing on it.</p>
<p>Just as colonizers attempted to strip the mugumo of its capacity to encode customary law, U.S. legal historians, again privileging English colonial common law, tend to overlook the capacity for historical “metes and bounds” methods – “systems of demarcation dependent on … movable stones, impermanent trees, and transient neighbors” – to encode localized knowledge and scaffold community relations.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> The network of notched trees was only one component in a larger socio-technical system. As legal scholar Maureen E. Brady explains, colonial American metes and bounds were often “supported by a variety of social and legal practices” that facilitated the enforcement of boundaries and transfer of land; those practices included “the ritual walking of boundaries, legal processes for communal boundary upkeep, and highly regulated land distributions to closed populations,” all of which “helped to reinforce shared understanding of the customized descriptions in deeds” and to cultivate witnesses.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> Perambulation, for instance, involved gathering the community – adults and children – to walk around the relevant property and, while doing so, to strike the boundary line and any boundary markers with branches, sticks, and stones.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> This social peripatetic, ceremonial pedagogy sought to inscribe those boundary lines in participants’ memories – for generations – and to contribute to regular maintenance of boundary markers.</p>
<p>Compared with modern means of demarcating land boundaries, “standardized to facilitate market transactions and yield economic development,” metes and bounds were inefficient. Yet they yielded “thick, customized information … tailored to the specific needs and preferences” of a local community.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a> The arboreal apparatus of metes and bounds “performed important social and legal functions in tying colonists to the land” and to each other, Brady argues, “facilitating compliance with a brand-new system of institutions, and controlling access to outsiders,” which promoted community cohesion and accountability.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a> Standardized maps and deeds, which arrived as populations grew and diversified and as land became more scarce, eventually opened up and regimented those markets – while also disentangling them from the local social fabric.</p>
<p>While the disappearance of metes and bounds and customary land tenure models may have diminished the <em>social</em> aspects of arboreal property demarcation, the trees rooted on those property boundaries – and the commitments and codes informing arboreal care – still interconnect the neighbors and broader communities that enjoy the trees’ shade, beauty, and bounty. “We have a 150+ [year] old oak tree on our property. Its branches cross several property lines,” Lisa Hermsen, a rhetoric scholar, told me on Twitter. “Negotiating how to prune the tree so as not to harm it has been incredibly communal. We all love the tree.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a> Those parties negotiating their shared obligations, she notes, “include the arborist as well as the insurance company and the electric company. And many talks across fences at leisure. Branches do fall,” she acknowledges, and such incidents typically highlight for this cast of stakeholders the tree’s myriad forms of worth: as an enhancer of property values, as a provider of apples and cherries, as camouflage for unsightly utility company equipment, as a home to treehouses and squirrels, as caster of shade for picnics and pontification. In assessing how to address their boundary-tree’s needs, Hermsen says, we’re constantly “balancing [the] interests of the tree and of everyone&#8217;s home and safety.”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>

<p>Such matters aren’t left to informal negotiation. Trees serve as an organic infrastructure for the legal delineation of property boundaries – and the trees that reside within and on those boundaries are then subject to their own laws regarding landowners’ arboreal rights, responsibilities, and liabilities.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a> It was once the case that, if a tree drew nourishment from adjacent properties, the tree belonged jointly to those various landowners.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a> This alimentary model of arboreal custody then shifted to a morphological model – one equating the tree with a particular part of its anatomy. Today, in the U.S. (and perhaps elsewhere, too), the ownership of a tree is typically determined by where the trunk is located; the keeper-of-the-trunk has the right to do whatever they wish with the tree, regardless of whatever comfort or enjoyment it provides to those nearby. Any fruit born by that tree, even if it dangles from branches that hang over the neighbor’s fence, typically belongs to those who steward the tree’s trunk – particularly if those trees have commercial value to the owner, as in an orchard. That said, the neighbor is, in most states, legally permitted to keep <em>fallen </em>fruit, since it likely has little value to the owner, who wouldn’t be able to retrieve it without trespassing anyway. Fallen leaves and twigs, however, are considered a general nuisance without a specific “owner” – which might displease those who live downwind or downhill from a neighbor’s acorn-shedding red oak.</p>
<p>If a storm downs a branch or topples a tree, causing damage to a neighbor’s property, the tree owner can be held liable if the tree was visibly unhealthy or unstable. Such obligations depend in part on where these neighbors live: urban landowners, including municipalities, are commonly expected to inspect their trees for decay and to eliminate any potential dangers, while such obligations are regarded as excessively onerous and impractical for rural residents. In a few jurisdictions, landowners are held liable for “artificial” vegetation they have planted and maintain themselves, but not for “natural” vegetation; such distinctions are often rather shady.</p>
<p>If a tree trunk straddles multiple landowners’ properties, as is the case for Hermsen, the tree is common property, and any alteration to it or distribution of its fruits requires communication and agreement between the joint owners. If a tree is planted squarely within the boundaries of a particular landowner’s yard but the trunk grows into an adjacent property, its ownership depends on the state in which it lives; in some states, the original owner retains ownership, yet in others, the tree becomes common property. If branches or roots encroach on a neighbor’s property, that neighbor, in most areas, is entitled to “self-help” – which might entail cutting any infringing appendages back to the property line, provided such alterations don’t damage the tree. Public utilities, who might be installing new infrastructure or widening roads, also typically have a right and an obligation to remove arboreal obstructions by doing only what is “reasonable and necessary.”</p>
<p>If a neighbor or utility does cause damage to the tree, the owner can sue, and they might be entitled not only to compensatory damages – determined by factoring in the trunk’s volume, the species, and physical condition – as well as “the difference in the fair market value of the property before and after the injury or the cost of restoring the property, whichever is the lesser amount.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a> If the tree is damaged willfully or with malicious intent, the owner could be entitled to treble damages, or three times the amount of the damages. Such calculations operationalize the tree as timber or as impact on property value. Yet the law does sometimes recognize other forms of arboreal value: some jurisdictions allow for the awarding of additional damages to account for the tree’s “intrinsic” value – which encompasses its utilitarian value (e.g., its provision of shade) and ornamental value – as well as its sentimental value or its part of a larger assemblage, as in an orchard or windbreak.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a> Still, as legal scholar Alyse Bertenthal argues, in tree law, “the victim is never the tree, only the owner of that tree…. Although it may have sustained the impact of wrongdoing, the tree remains only a measure of human loss, not the bearer of that loss.”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a> Even Christopher D. Stone, in his classic <em>Should Trees Have Standing?: Law, Morality, and the Environment</em>, from 1972, and those jurists profoundly informed by his work, still mostly frame arboreal rights in anthropocentric terms.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Tree disputes are “never just about the trees,” tree lawyer Barri Bonapart told <em>Atlas Obscura’s </em>Natasha Geiling. “The trees often serve as lightning rods for other issues that are the psychological underpinning of a dispute that people might have with each other.”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a> Arboreal law – both that addressing trees as markers of landed property and as property themselves – is about capital, colonialism, commemoration, the commons, and community. It’s also based on establishing trees themselves as bodies, as ontological beings, that mediate the relations between human and social bodies – from neighbors to nation-states – in space. Does the law conceive of a tree as a mere commodity: something to be transformed into lumber or to enhance the market value of a home? Does the law define a tree’s being based on where it derives its sustenance – that is, where its leaves and roots draw sunlight and nutrients from the sky and soil – or by where its trunk happens to rise from the earth? What about the branches and the roots: when they cross a property line, create obstacles for utility companies, or obscure million-dollar views, they seem suddenly to become ontologically separate from the trunk. And what of the leaves and fruits affixed to those branches? Their essentiality to the tree-as-legal-entity seems to depend on whether their crop is on the branch or on the ground. How, then, do we think about the tree’s other incidental properties and capacities: its provision of shade and shelter for multiple species, its production of oxygen, its consumption of carbon dioxide, its capacity to prevent erosion, its contributions to community wellness? Are these properties not part of the tree’s “intrinsic value,” too?<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Given how expansive and communal are its provisions, it seems absurd to regard the tree as privately possessable property. The lengths to which jurists have gone to reconceptualize the tree – lopping off its roots and branches when they don’t fit the rubrics for legal assessment, framing its value in relation to the real-estate or timber market – attests to the tree’s resistance to such reduction. To then enlist the tree in the work of legitimating a regime that reduces land to property – a colonial system that, as Brenna Bhandar explains, “naturaliz[es] possession and occupation” – ultimately constitutes of reduction of the social world, too. Private property, Bhandar writes, consolidates “language, ways of seeing, and modes of subjectivity that render indigenous and colonized populations,” especially those who do regard the world as possessable, “as outside of history, lacking the requisite cultural practices, habits of thought, and economic organization to be considered as sovereign, rational economic subjects.”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a> Yet as Potawatomi plant ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer argues, it is instead the settler preoccupation with property that is impoverished. “In the settler mind,” land is “real estate, capital, or natural resources. But to our people, it was everything: identity, the connection to our ancestors, the home of our nonhuman kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the source of all that sustained us. Our lands were where our responsibility to the world was enacted, sacred ground. It belonged to itself; it was a gift, not a commodity, so it could never be bought or sold.”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>The trees on that land are all these things, too: they are emblems and embodiments of broader, deeper land politics and social relations. Kimmerer describes how “pecan trees and their kin show a capacity for concerted action, for unity of purpose that transcends the individual trees. They ensure somehow that all stand together and thus survive.”<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a> Settler colonialism instead positions trees, and the land that sustains them, as individuated, parcelable commodities – as points and lines on an atlas of social friction and division. The trees themselves clearly refuse this diminution, stretching their roots, poking their branches, casting their leaves, throwing their shade wherever they please, regardless of who owns the land below.</p>
