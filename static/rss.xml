During his first visit to Gaza, Mazen sought to send his father a Polaroid picture of the land where the family home once stood — but from which his father had been barred since his exile. Unable to send the card through the post, Mazen serendipitously encountered a woman, Naima, who promised to hand-deliver the card — yet he later learned that she&#8217;s a notoriously unreliable messenger. Assuming the card had been lost, Mazen was surprised to hear, three weeks later, that his father had received the postcard — mere days before suffering a stroke. Yet when Mazen returned to Beirut, he found that his convalescing father possessed neither the card nor memory of its existence.</p>
<p>Years later, Mazen and his father spot Naima on television, which prompts his father to recollect a vivid dream: this same woman had visited him and delivered a postcard — Mazen&#8217;s postcard — depicting his Gazan homeland (Mazen&#8217;s mystery echoes that in <a href="https://www.europaeditions.com/book/9781609458386/the-postcard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anne Berest&#8217;s <em>The Postcard</em></a>). On TV, Naima is gathering letters from school children, one of whom proclaims: "We’re writing letters to the world; envelopes is all that we found in the food storage facility. We write letters so we forget how hungry we are. Naima will deliver them. She sees addresses in her dreams. She knows by heart all the addresses in the world." The next day, the school is bombed, and Naima and the envelopes disappear with it. &#8220;The only meaningful thing I could do at that moment,&#8221; Mazen writes, &#8220;was to go down and check my mailbox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like Naima, Palestinian-American artist Emily Jacir serves as both a vessel of hope and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2021.1894397" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a human link</a> within a broken infrastructure — a conduit for messages that connect severed lives (Lydia Pyne, in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo130703260.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her history of postcards</a>, also emphasizes their material role in connecting social networks). For her 2001-3 <em>Where We Come From </em>project, Jacir asked Palestinian exiles: &#8220;If I could do anything for you, anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?&#8221; &#8220;Taking advantage of her ability to move about relatively freely in Israel with an American passport,&#8221; <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/2008.20.2.A-B/essay/desire-diaspora-emily-jacir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T. J. Demos explains</a>, &#8220;Jacir promised to realize the desires of those forbidden entry into their homeland.&#8221; Her execution of those promises — placing flowers on a mother&#8217;s grave, visiting a restaurant, playing soccer — manifests in an installation: black texts, in both Arabic and English, on white panels, documenting contributors&#8217; requests; alongside color photographs verifying Jacir&#8217;s fulfillment of those requests.</p>
<p>Jacir&#8217;s paired texts and photos could be read as the opposing faces of a postcard, with the image capturing an aspirational (if often heartbreakingly mundane) site and experience, and the text offering a personalized message. Yet here the text — which exemplifies Barthes&#8217; <em>punctum</em>, the subjectively poignant element that pricks and bruises — <em>precedes </em>and <em>precipitates </em>the photo. And what is so puncturing about those photos is the contrast between the depicted scenes&#8217; banality for Jacir and their utter impossibility for the texts&#8217; authors. (The anticipatory, instigating text is again present in Jacir&#8217;s <em>letter to a friend</em>, <a href="https://bmoreart.com/2023/12/postcards-from-palestine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an epistolary film</a> in which Jacir gathers evidence of the impending occupation of her family home in Bethlehem and asks a friend, the architect Eyal Weizman, to begin a preemptive investigation.)</p>
<p>The recognition of Palestinians&#8217; sovereignty depends so much on the ontology of rhetorical forms: <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262036153/mapping-israel-mapping-palestine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the map</a>, the letter, the <a href="https://palarchive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archival</a> <a href="https://librarianswithpalestine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14650045.2011.562944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID cards and passports</a>, the ceasefire &#8220;deal,&#8221; the mandate, the declaration, the treaty, the small, light postcard that embodies a promise of mobility so many Palestinian people themselves do not possess. And as Maafour and Jacir show, those material media forms, as well as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2021.1894397#abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the people who carry them</a>, often constitute an informal <em>infrastructure </em>in their own right, particularly when, as <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/helga-tawil-souri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helga Tawil-Souri</a> demonstrates, &#8220;official&#8221; infrastructures are unreliable, obstructionist, surveillant, extractive, or deadly.</p>
<p>Nadine Fattaleh, a Palestinian writer and translator from Amman, acknowledges the infrastructures of censorship — implemented by everyone from state governments to social media platforms to university administrations — that exist to impede Palestine solidarity protest and the circulation of protest images. Last year, New York University, where Fattaleh is a PhD student (and where I, coincidentally, earned my PhD, too), was particularly draconian, <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/nyu-students-gaza-encampment-open-space-barricade-closed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barricading public spaces</a>, arresting <a href="https://nyunews.com/news/2024/09/05/inside-nyu-pro-palestinian-disciplinary-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protesting students</a> <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-condemns-faculty-arrests-amidst-protest-crackdown-nyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and faculty</a>, disciplining those students by requiring them to complete an &#8220;Ethos Integrity&#8221; training and write a reflection paper, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyu-journalism-professor-pro-palestine-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning journalism faculty</a> <em>documenting </em>peaceful protests, <a href="https://facultyforpalestine.education/2025/01/08/january-8-2025-press-release-new-york-university-launches-unprecedented-campaign-of-collective-punishment-against-students-protesting-genocide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issuing year-long suspensions</a> to students involved in sit-ins, and establishing <a href="https://nyunews.com/news/2024/08/26/nyu-updates-conduct-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictive conduct and speech policies</a> that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/08/27/zionist-nyu-gaza-campus-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deem Zionists a protected class</a>. Again we see an authority delimiting the recognition of Palestinian sovereignty by controlling the rhetorical forms in which, and the infrastructures through which, political speech can transpire.</p>

<p>Fatalleh suggests that, amidst these impediments, &#8220;the medium of print has returned to combat repression, with the increased production of posters, flyers, zines, and pamphlets circulated at demonstrations, community gatherings, and university encampments.&#8221; And at NYU&#8217;s Asian/Pacific/American Institute last fall, she created a &#8220;living archive&#8221; of these print materials for her <a href="https://apa.nyu.edu/materials-of-solidarity-october-3-december-6-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Materials of Solidarity </i>exhibition</a>, which, she noted, &#8220;echoes the movement’s insistence: &#8216;the more they try to silence us, the louder we will be.'&#8221; Here, that amplification is effected not sonically, but through graphic vibrancy, material accumulation and distribution, and affective engagement.</p>

<p>Immediately inside the gallery door and to the left one finds a sample of materials from the People&#8217;s Library at the Palestine solidarity encampments, as well as a selection of zines from Fattaleh&#8217;s own collection. I&#8217;ve included a few above; Fattaleh made sure to draw my attention to the lovely box set of maps, <em>A1 Block Walker’s Log</em>. On the opposite wall we encounter wall text and rows of orange envelopes featuring, on one side, a photograph depicting a keffiyeh-wrapped protester and an assortment of hand-lettered protest posters, and, on the other side, the curatorial statement in compressed form. These envelopes structure our engagement with the work situated deeper into the gallery.</p>
<p>On the perpendicular wall — what we see directly in front of us upon entry — are three sets of shelves, each with four rows, collectively featuring stacks of ~80 postcards: &#8220;The collectively assembled postcards, paired with documentation of the intimate reflections of anonymous contributors, are a palimpsest of our community and its protest of the ongoing, mediatized genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza,&#8221; Fattaleh says. These texts, personalized captions for the images on the cards&#8217; flip side, are punctums, too. We&#8217;re to gather and store a selection of these cards in our orange envelopes.</p>

<p>The postcards depict protest media in myriad formats: photos of students reading texts about Palestinian history, diagrams outlining the role of Israeli technology in entrenching apartheid, mixed-media collages of Palestinians killed under occupation, cut-up poetry about the prevailing solidarity amidst institutional violence at the encampments, a photo of assorted cardboard protest signs, depictions of the NYPD&#8217;s tools of sonic warfare, a photo of annotated and defaced copies of university policies, a photo of solidarity banners hung from the atrium screen in NYU&#8217;s Bobst Library.</p>

It offers reproductions of postcards as materials of solidarity that must proliferate into the world. From our campus and workplace, to streets and open spaces, let our images and words multiply, distributing the collective energy of protest against genocide and reverberating the refusal of our collective complicity.&#8221; (Similarly, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870050110940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annelies Moors writes</a> about Macha Saca&#8217;s post-intifada postcards depicting the diversity of Palestinian dress; those cards, through their circulation, were meant both to encourage Palestinians to be &#8220;aware of and appreciate their own cultural heritage,&#8221; and to inform foreigners about that heritage &#8220;in order to be convinced of the historical presence and national rights of the Palestinian people.&#8221;)</p>
<p>In late November I attended a gallery tour, after which I asked Fattaleh to say a bit more about the postcard as her chosen medium — and about what it means to share these postcards within a gallery on the third floor of an access-restricted university building that visitors must register, at least a day in advance, to enter. She explained that those of us who gather in the gallery — an inclusive space of exception on campus — can then spread its messages throughout the city. We are its social broadcast network, its circulation infrastructure. I imagined the postcards as the watermelon seeds depicted throughout the exhibition, and us, the exhibition visitors, as the pollinators who distribute them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Images are progenitors of another possible world,&#8221; Fattaleh writes. And images <em>on postcards</em> — a medium defined by its brevity and exposure; a medium that, <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/short-takes/notes-on-postcards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Jennifer Croft describes it</a>, is &#8220;hardy and delicate at once, dated and timeless, telltale and intimate, representative and not&#8221;; a medium both <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2022/05/19/postcards-from-ellsworth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;semi-intimate and semi-public</a>&#8221; — are sent out into the world-as-it-is, to invite their recipients to hold in their hands a microcosmic prototype of worlds-to-be. Long deployed as commercial advertisements, or as emblems of &#8220;<a href="https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03528-4.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqYLI_bLAqXk82IN4y7i2kIfbSd6ALj-VmwJq58Drtxt11Csxnr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colonialist exoticism and political propaganda</a>,&#8221; postcards can also create a different topology and phenomenology of protest and political education: one that transpires through intimate, individual engagements and a literal <em>holding </em>of possibilities, while also signaling the potential for incremental, global circulation and propagation.</p>
<p>Ellsworth Kelly, like <a href="https://archive.aperture.org/article/2009/4/4/walker-evans-and-the-picture-postcard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1969.094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artists</a> <a href="https://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/mail-art-ephemera#tab:thumbnails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before</a> <a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2011/04/01/zoe-leonard-you-see-i-am-here-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him</a>, appreciated the postcard&#8217;s material affordances and limitations. He worked at the Farley post office! <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2022/05/19/postcards-from-ellsworth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Rebecca Bengal explains</a>, &#8220;For Kelly, postcards were a vacation from the studio. They were both outlet and outline, made quickly and intuitively: Some were places to work out ideas, and a few loose compositions would lead in more obvious ways to larger, more fully realized pieces. Others were just to escape, to play and have fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maarouf&#8217;s and Jacir&#8217;s and Fattaleh&#8217;s collaborators&#8217; postcards encapsulate dreams and laments. In their very form they embody an easy mobility both impossible and aspirational; the images and messages they carry are means of &#8220;working out ideas.&#8221; In their accumulation and abundant circulation, perhaps these postcards, then, can <a href="https://viviensansour.com/Palestine-Heirloom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plant seeds</a> and model <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02637758221139857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculative infrastructures</a> for worlds to come.</p>

<p>[Some folks are calling this an &#8220;article&#8221;; it&#8217;s just an annoyingly long blog post. Had I had an editor, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;d be much shorter.

<p>Today marks the one-year anniversary of my admission to the hospital with a strangulated hernia. Despite the excruciating pain, that event catalyzed what was, hands down, the absolute best week of my 2023. And if we were to measure &#8220;best week&#8221; by <em>contrasting </em>that particular week with the year&#8217;s 51 other weeks — during which I cried pretty much all the time, had chest pains, rarely slept, lost an awful lot of hair, and half-heartedly wished to be struck by a bus — I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to say that Hernia Week was one of the best weeks of my entire life.</p>
<p>I was scheduled to give a talk at Barnard — a reflection on my teaching career — the next day. (I <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2024/09/24/the-conviviality-covenant-on-teaching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>did </em>end up sharing the presentation</a> nine months later). But that Thursday night, shortly after I talked to my dad on the phone, I started to feel ill. I blamed the ice cream sandwich I bought at the deli downstairs from my NY apartment. Still, I tried to press forward with my slide deck; this would be another all-night prep session — because that&#8217;s how I managed <em>all </em>of my talks (those I hadn&#8217;t canceled) during this period when &#8220;my own work&#8221; rarely crossed my mind. Within a couple hours, though, I was unable to stand or sit or bend or twist. What unwelcome <em>déjà vu.</em></p>
<p>I experienced a strikingly similar episode six months earlier in Philadelphia, where I had recently moved for a new job that got off to an epically rocky start. I&#8217;ve experienced mild &#8220;GI issues,&#8221; but this was unlike anything I&#8217;d ever felt before. So, at around 9pm, my partner and I headed to the university hospital, and we waited. And waited. And waited. Which seemed fitting, given that I had been waiting for months — to no avail — to find new doctors in this new-to-me city. I was repeatedly told that no gynecologists or dermatologists or gastroenterologists — <em>none</em> — within the university health system were accepting new patients. I&#8217;d also been waiting for a prescribed GI scan; earlier, when I called to make the appointment, I was told to &#8220;call back next July&#8221; — a whole year later.</p>
<p>After eight hours in the ER — during which I was repeatedly reprimanded for my inability to sit up straight — I abruptly experienced an immediate and rapturous relief. All the muscles in my abdomen — which, for hours, had been stretched tight like an exercise band, quivering with exhaustion —  went slack. My cold sweat evaporated instantaneously. I could stand up again.</p>
<p>It was 5am: still no doctor. So, I signed a waiver acknowledging that I was willfully releasing myself from the hospital&#8217;s (and symbolically, by extension, the university&#8217;s) &#8220;care,&#8221; and we went home.</p>
<p>The second time around, in December, I writhed alone in my tiny New York studio for a couple hours — but the relief never came. I crawled down to 2nd Avenue and hailed a taxi for the three-minute, ten-block trip to NYU Langone. The potholes were torturous. I told the ER doctors I most likely had food poisoning again, but when the repeated hits of morphine offered no relief, and when the vomiting commenced, they took me in for a CT scan, discovered the hernia, and rushed me into surgery, where they excised several inches of my small intestine.* Had I not received immediate care, the intestine could&#8217;ve burst, and I could&#8217;ve gotten sepsis. I amuse myself by imagining that, had this happened in Philly — and this was indeed the exact same ailment I experienced in Philly six months earlier; it simply managed to <em>fix itself </em>there — I probably would&#8217;ve died in the waiting room, and the staff would&#8217;ve yelled at me.</p>

<p>I woke up in Langone&#8217;s recovery room at around 10am. Andy was there; he&#8217;d dropped off the dog and jumped on the first train up to NY. I spent the following week in the hospital&#8217;s graciously designed new <a href="https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/13522-nyu-langone-health-by-ennead-and-nbbj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimmel Pavilion</a>, surrounded by kind and movingly competent nurses (I loved them so much!) in Life Savers-colored Figs scrubs, attended to by a stellar all-women-of-color team of surgeons (I loved them, too!), looking out across the East River toward Greenpoint from my 11th-floor room.</p>

<p>The whole thing was spectacular. A+! 15 out of 10! Sure, I was in pain —  my guts had all been rearranged, and I needed a bunch of staples to keep them from spilling out of my abdomen — but joy numbed the hurt. It wasn&#8217;t just the painkillers; I rarely pushed my &#8220;pain button.&#8221; I was genuinely blissed out: so happy — literally giddy — to be in a place where work couldn&#8217;t touch me. Where no one could fill my days with meetings or make me review 100 job applications over the weekend. Where I wasn&#8217;t clocking 80- or 90-hour workweeks. Where I could ignore the news of yet another campus crisis and yet more administrative cruelty. Where I could listen to my body rather than denying it existed. I had, just two nights before, submitted the grades for the most difficult and demoralizing semester in my teaching career — my first at this new university, after 18.5 years of <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2024/12/03/teaching-testimonials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damn good teaching</a> at The New School — and I was glad to be free, for a short while, of the self doubt and &#8220;what the hell have I gotten myself into?!&#8221; regret. That hospital bed granted me a bird&#8217;s eye view over the city I loved for 25 years — a city where, despite my roughed-up physical condition, I felt warm and cared for, where I could be a self that I actually recognized and liked, where I felt at home.</p>

<p>That week of therapeutic rhapsody also precipitated a revelation: my body had sent me an unmistakable signal. I had been fortunate up to that point in my life to enjoy good health. I&#8217;d never before spent a night in the hospital, and my only other brief visit to the ER was necessitated five years earlier by some ridiculously-out-of-control uterine fibroids that I later had expelled via a quick-and-easy outpatient laparoscopic surgery. But as my supine convalescent days accumulated, I became<em> grateful </em>to my body for precipitating a realization: you can&#8217;t do this anymore, you idiot. This job isn&#8217;t worth the continual dread and self-denial. You&#8217;re too old for the chronic sleep deprivation. The arrhythmia that used to manifest once every five years or so: it now kicks in a couple times a week. And you&#8217;re too good at what you do to feel so awful about it, and so incompetent at it.</p>
<p><strong>My body had refused to participate in <a href="https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca31.3.01/367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my refusal</a> (or failure?) to refuse untenable demands. That&#8217;s, like, a triple negative. Put differently: my brain couldn&#8217;t stop me, so that tiny but mighty intestinal diverticulum did.</strong></p>

<p>Such psychophysiological ruptures, such existential epiphanies, seem to be increasingly common — especially among my mid-career women faculty and staff colleagues, and especially since 2021. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of friends who&#8217;ve shared their own exhaustion and breakdown stories, their own hospitalization chronicles, their own fantasies about a more sustainable extra-academic life. What marketable skills did they possess? What other industries might want them? What jobs would allow them to <em>turn off </em>every once in a while, to disentangle their identities and sense of self-worth from the work they produced?</p>
<p>Since I arrived at my new institution, several colleagues — most of them women — have left: some for other universities; some for paths unknown. A couple friends had no definitive plan; they simply needed <em>out</em>. Nearly all of these women, here and elsewhere, said that they kept waiting — for years — for things to get better, assuming that some day, after they&#8217;d paid their dues, they&#8217;d magically pass through a portal into the healthy occupational satisfaction their (senior men) advisors enjoyed decades earlier.</p>
<p>[Late edit: I neglected to mention, when I originally shared this post, how all of this &#8220;mutual mentoring&#8221; among women colleagues — which might seem like mere after-hours socialization — is actually a form of obligatory, compensatory occupational therapy. As Ahmed also acknowledges, this sharing-of stories-and-strategies constitutes informal, supplemental &#8220;professional development&#8221; and &#8220;performance training&#8221; necessitated by the challenges of the job. It might be rooted in friendship and care, but it&#8217;s still <em>part of the job</em>; it&#8217;s required for survival in the workplace.]</p>
<p>Yet many of us eventually realized that such jobs no longer exist in the academy. There are no secretaries to competently and expeditiously manage quotidian administrative tasks, no <a href="https://thesociologicalreview.org/podcasts/thanks-for-typing/thanks-to-my-wife-gender-and-politics-in-the-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wives to type up the manuscripts</a>. What we get instead is more &#8220;talent management,&#8221; &#8220;student success management,&#8221; and &#8220;course management&#8221; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-hates-workday-human-resources-customer-service-software-fortune-500-2024-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software</a> to &#8220;automate&#8221; those tasks (by which I mean: dramatically <em>increase </em>human workloads through <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199543052.001.0001/acref-9780199543052-e-1338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsibilization</a> and technical dysfunction). Adjunctification has played a key role, too. As Erin Bartram <a href="https://contingentmagazine.org/2023/01/07/a-profession-if-you-can-keep-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in 2023 in <em>Contingent Magazine</em></a>,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Adjunctification has always harmed the people in the middle of the hierarchy [—]  because, of course, tenured and tenure-track faculty are not the top of this hierarchy. "Burnout" is a serious and growing problem, especially for scholars of marginalized groups; it’s making you all miserable, and leading some to leave the profession altogether. But let’s be clear: <strong>this “burnout” that secure scholars are feeling is phantom pain where their colleagues should be.</strong> Or, to use a term that every other normal worker in the US uses to describe their workplace under these conditions: you are suffering from the effects of <strong>intentional systemic understaffing.</strong></p>
<p>This means we&#8217;ve got a much smaller proportion of full-time faculty among whom to share institutional service, and thus a larger &#8220;share&#8221; of an ever-larger administrative burden for each of the lucky few full-timers — at least those who agree to participate. What&#8217;s more, we&#8217;ve got an ever-more cruel world, with its collapsing social safety nets and increasing income inequality and political polarization and misogyny and stupid technologies, that manifests on campus, making all of us more testy and traumatized.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/faculty-and-staff-are-feeling-anxious-depressed-and-burnt-out-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 3, 2024, article in <em>The Chronicle</em></a>, Adrienne Lu discussed a study published in October by the Healthy Minds Network:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">More than half of [faculty and staff] respondents said that over the past year, <strong>their [academic] job took a negative toll on their mental or emotional health.</strong> Nearly six in 10 said they felt burnt out because of their work. Half said they needed help for emotional or mental-health problems such as feeling sad, blue, anxious, or nervous, over the previous year.</p>
<p>As if the aforementioned threats weren&#8217;t enough, the COVID years have added new burdens. The pandemic and all of its attendant care work, both at home and on campus (physical and virtual) — along with right-wing attacks on schools and universities; renewed threats to international students, students of color, and LGBTQ+ students; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42438-024-00524-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI fetishism</a>; as well as the Palestine protests and administrators&#8217; cruel, cowardly responses — are all among the factors most recently stoking academic turmoil.</p>
<p>Managing these burdens tends to fall particularly heavily on faculty and staff of marginalized identities. Lu reports that female, transgender, and nonbinary faculty members were more likely to report speaking with students about <em>their </em>mental health — and that &#8220;supporting students’ mental health had taken a toll on their own.&#8221; [The studies below focus on <em>women</em>, but many of the same dynamics certainly apply to transgender and nonbinary faculty and staff.]</p>
<p>For the past twenty years or so we&#8217;ve accumulated evidence of entrenched gender imbalances in faculty (and, I&#8217;d add, staff) service loads. In 2017, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-017-9454-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassandra Guarino and Victor Borden found</a> that &#8220;<strong>women perform significantly more internal service than men, particularly in service to the campus.</strong>&#8221; They also found &#8220;no statistically significant differences in the aggregate amount of external service performed&#8221; — in other words, everyone serves their disciplines and supports vital industry-wide infrastructures dependent on volunteerism — but women do &#8220;report performing more national and community service than men when we look at subcategories of external service.&#8221; Guarino and Borden also acknowledge what most of us have long lamented: that &#8220;the vast majority of faculty receive no extra compensation (or credit in any form!) for&#8230; internal service activities because <strong>contributing as good citizens</strong> to the academic community is part of their job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan Purdy, in her 2024 &#8220;<a href="https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/pjcr/vol12/iss1/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closing the Gap: A Literature Review of Gender Disparities in Higher Education</a>,&#8221; corroborates these findings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">[W]omen engage far more in extra service hours than men across all disciplines&#8230;. The research also underscores that one reason for women&#8217;s heightened involvement in service is not due to a preferential bias or desire but rather that <strong>women often find themselves more inclined to say yes to service requests than men</strong>&#8230;. The rationale behind this inclination is linked to <strong>social pressures and power dynamics</strong>, especially when women are asked by their superiors to serve&#8230;.</p>
<p>In other words, women are less likely to <em><strong>refuse</strong></em><em>. </em>Margaretha Järvinen and Nanna Mik-Meyer&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00113921231224754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giving and Receiving: Gendered Service Work in Academia</a>&#8221; caused a stir earlier this year by both highlighting the <em>volume</em> of research corroborating the existence of these gender disparities, and documenting a range of gendered entitlements and perceived obligations — most of which are all-too-familiar to women. The authors write:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Studies show that <strong>women are asked to conduct more service tasks and that they are more inclined to accept service requests once asked</strong>&#8230; Another finding is that different kinds of service are gendered, meaning that men pursue more prestigious service roles (e.g. committee chairing and editorships), whereas <strong>women are more involved in low-status working groups, mentoring and student and faculty service</strong> <strong>that does not show on their CV.</strong></p>
<p>Echoing justifications I&#8217;ve heard from countless women colleagues throughout my career, one of Järvinen and Mik-Meyer&#8217;s respondents, an associate professor, explained that she takes on service tasks because &#8220;<strong>we all have to contribute to the running of this department, don’t we?</strong>&#8221; As I&#8217;ve repeatedly said to myself and my colleagues, and as I&#8217;ve been told: We all have to take our turn. We all have to pull our weight, yes? Right?! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f974.png" alt="🥴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And the farther up the ladder you advance, the more hierarchically-assigned service you&#8217;re &#8220;eligible&#8221; to perform. One of the &#8220;perqs&#8221; of promotion is qualification for more &#8220;exclusive&#8221; service, while still maintaining the &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; service; it&#8217;s additive. A full professor, for instance, is tapped to evaluate dossiers for post-probationary, tenure, <em>and</em> promotion-to-full reviews. Once you&#8217;ve managed to climb the rungs, you <em>should </em>feel obligated to support those behind you.</p>
<p>Järvinen and Mik-Meyer explain that &#8220;women’s obligation-driven relationship with their workplace can also be associated with a <strong>fear of negative reactions if they select not to engage in service activities,</strong> a fear that several of our women participants describe as justified.&#8221; <a href="https://feministkilljoys.com/2017/06/30/no/">Sarah Ahmed acknowledges that</a>, in many academic contexts, &#8220;<strong>no</strong> has not been heard as <strong>no</strong>.&#8221; Supervisors &#8220;might not stop you from saying <strong>no</strong> but they make it costly for you to say <strong>no.</strong>&#8221; My own experience has also shown that attempts at refusal are often met with retribution or rebutted with guilt trips.</p>
<p>A sense of obligation is also often rooted in the desire to create a functional workplace and a positive learning environment — despite institutional disorder and general global discord. Another of Järvinen and Mik-Meyer&#8217;s contributors explained: &#8220;Often, my [Head of Department] says: &#8216;Could you please do this because <strong>if I ask other people, they are not going to do this well</strong>,&#8217; and these other people are usually men.&#8221; Management often flatters women by complimenting their service competence. I&#8217;ve been told: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a knack for this&#8221; — which is how I found myself directing a 500-student program (which grew to a 600-student program) and managing a faculty of ~60 (1/3 full-time colleagues, 2/3 recently unionized contingent colleagues) at the age of 29 (this story is <em>so </em>typical for junior folks at The New School!). The complimentary &#8220;we know you can handle it&#8221; is how I&#8217;ve found myself serving on a dozen simultaneous committees, or chairing simultaneous task forces, or simultaneously directing two academic programs across three divisions of the university. I&#8217;ve also seen, on many occasions, women colleagues deploy this rationale themselves: If we ask Chad to direct the program, he&#8217;ll make a mess, which will ultimately make more work for us.</p>
<p>And maybe this is exactly what Chad <em>wants </em>us to say. Järvinen and Mik-Meyer find that men more often deploy various strategies of avoidance. One said: &#8220;I know [for] myself that if there is a task that I don’t find fun and interesting, I’m not good at doing it&#8230;.&#8221; Another relayed: &#8220;When the [Head of Department] asked me to be part of this committee, I said: ‘&#8230;I always work hard, but <strong>don’t ask me to be involved in bureaucratic processes</strong>. I think all these committees are completely useless&#8217;&#8230; Obviously, that was okay; at least he didn’t ask me again.&#8221; Another: &#8220;On the rare occasion when service things land on my table, I tell the HoD: ‘Are you sure this is the right address? <strong>Administration is not my core competence</strong>.&#8217; We joke a little about that, and my HoD typically agrees [laughs].&#8221; Still another admitted: &#8220;It’s all about <strong>convincing your HoD that you’re more useful to the department as a researcher</strong> and let those who are interested in administration do the service work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Järvinen and Mik-Meyer describe those male faculty who see themselves &#8220;on a prestigious research track&#8221;: &#8220;The group’s commitment to research, typically secured by <strong>prolonged periods of external funding and ‘buy-outs,’</strong> has disconnected them from teaching and internal service and secured them an <strong>‘uncontaminated’ researcher role</strong>, one that is accepted by management because of these scholars’ reputations as ‘excellent.'&#8221; Through various search committees and faculty reviews (about 150 of them) I&#8217;ve encountered some men (and a few women) who&#8217;ve enjoyed so many fellowships and course buyouts that they&#8217;ve been exempted from teaching for years at a time, and have been &#8220;unavailable&#8221; for substantial committees and program administration. I always note such divisions of labor in my reviews and evaluate folks&#8217; scholarship in light of what other responsibilities might be distracting them from research.</p>
<p>That experience has also illuminated <strong>disparities between institutional classes.</strong> After many years in an <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/basic-classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;R3&#8221; division of an &#8220;R2&#8221; university, I&#8217;m now at an &#8220;R1&#8221; institution</a>, and I&#8217;m suddenly &#8220;qualified&#8221; and &#8220;eligible&#8221; to evaluate faculty in equally self-flattering &#8220;peer&#8221; institutions. Lucky me. I received about 20 external review requests this past year. I see more extreme cases of privilege — faculty whose jobs are an entirely different species than mine or my colleagues&#8217; at The New School, at regional public universities, and at community colleges. For instance, my New School colleagues — who still write fabulous books and produce amazing films and design spectacular buildings — also shoulder teaching loads and service obligations that would be the equivalent of an <em>entire</em> <em>second job </em>for some protected R1 faculty.</p>
<p>Pandemic burnout has precipitated new consciousness of such inequities and catalyzed disillusionment and demoralization. Many of us have shed <a href="https://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2018/vocational-awe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Fobazi Ettarh has called</a> &#8220;vocational awe&#8221;; we now see the academy as the &#8220;job&#8221; that it is, rather than the &#8220;calling&#8221; we imagined. The pandemic &#8220;experience of aloneness and alienation&#8230; <strong>has forever changed how I think about my life in the academy, and what I want to (and can) give to it</strong>,&#8221; Susan Cahill writes in “<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/racar/2024-v49-n1-racar09666/1114514ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Burnout and Recovery: Academic Life, Lately</a>.” She stresses that &#8220;the structures of the neoliberal university&#8230; do not create spaces of care. We often try to create these spaces between individuals, to <strong>form solidarities around shared struggle and grief</strong>, which is more difficult when we collectively find ourselves in burnout rather than in recovery. <strong>Where do we go when we don’t even have each other?</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Some faculty and staff choose to find each other by organizing; we&#8217;ve witnessed several vibrant AAUP chapters and unions emerge over the past year. Again, <a href="https://feministkilljoys.com/2017/06/30/no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahmed advises</a> that we &#8220;find ways of working with others to keep <em>no</em> going&#8221;; we must practice <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/willful-subjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">willful,</a> collective <a href="https://scalar.usc.edu/works/refusal/ways-forward.9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusal</a>.

And some — particularly those who&#8217;ve found that individualized <em>refusal</em> isn&#8217;t enough, that &#8220;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2010/09/27/just-say-no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just</a> <a href="https://publicseminar.org/essays/just-say-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/to-find-happiness-in-academe-women-should-just-say-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no</a>&#8221; just <a href="https://www.aacu.org/liberaleducation/articles/service-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn&#8217;t sufficient</a> — feel the need to leave. <strong>Resignation,</strong> <a href="https://feministkilljoys.com/2016/08/27/resignation-is-a-feminist-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahmed argues</a>, &#8220;is a feminist issue&#8221;: it &#8220;offers a feminist hearing because a public action has a wider reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christie Wilcox <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/women-faculty-feel-pushed-academia-poor-workplace-climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last October in <em>Science</em></a> that &#8220;<strong>women full professors are 19% more likely than men at the same career stage to leave academia</strong>, as compared with 6% for women assistant professors and 10% for associates. Women’s attrition rates were also higher at less prestigious schools and in non-STEM fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their 2023 &#8220;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14749041231191888?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Housework in Pandemic Times</a>,&#8221; Danielle Docka-Filipek and Lindsey Stone find that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Women are exiting gender‐oppressive, disproportionately emotionally demanding workplaces to preserve their own mental health</strong> when they might otherwise thrive in their academic labors if either expectations for caregiving did not “overflow” from the “private,” domestic realm and into the “public” sphere of the academic workplace, or such labors were made visible and attributed adequate valuation in career advancement metrics. Relatedly, <strong>the masculine individualistic strategy of “dodging” less visible, yet vital service tasks is not a sustainable or ethical path. <em>Refusing</em> to “care” is an unrealistic and harmful strategy</strong> for both the individual and for the collective if reciprocal care and mutualism are to happen, especially in moments of vulnerability (italics mine).</p>
<p>Kathryn Hayes, in her 2024 &#8220;<a href="https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/resisting-sexisms-aggression-and-burnout-in-academic-leadership-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resisting Sexisms, Aggression, and Burnout in Academic Leadership</a>,&#8221; found that, even amongst leaders, &#8220;the onus remains on women&#8230; to <strong>rely on their personal resources to overcome issues such as burnout or cultural sexism,&#8221; </strong>rather than addressing those institutional dysfunctions and inequities &#8220;through systemic institutional or sectoral change.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to rely on my &#8220;personal resources&#8221; these past few years. I needed my body to refuse my brain&#8217;s compulsion to press forward. Before then, <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2022/11/20/46893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I described two years ago</a> when I stepped away from The New School after nearly two decades, I refused very little. For my first two years on the job, I managed all admissions and theses in a 500+-student program. Because I handled the load, I was flattered into directing that graduate program, with its growing student body and ~60 faculty. Within weeks I learned that our sole student advisor and support staff person were leaving, so I assumed much of their work, too, for my first semester on the job. Subsequently, there were some years when I served on 10 or 12 substantial internal committees. I also carried a formal advising load of 30 or 40 students (and worked with dozens more across the university) every semester and advised about 70 graduate theses and dissertations with the understanding that I was meeting a &#8220;quota.&#8221; When I was invited to move laterally to a new division to start a new graduate minor that bridged two divisions of the university, I was asked within a semester to take on, in addition, the directorship of undergraduate studies, which required liaising with a <em>third</em> division.</p>
<p>I was reluctant <em>to refuse </em>any of this — initially because I hadn&#8217;t yet earned tenure, and later for many of the reasons I listed above: because I figured we all had to &#8220;take our turn&#8221;; because I was told that &#8220;no one else was available&#8221;; because I didn&#8217;t want the burden to fall to junior colleagues (although plenty of burdens fell to <em>me </em>as a junior person!); because I was embarrassed and frustrated by dysfunction and wanted to try to make things better; and because, in a university where 87% of the faculty are contingent, the service load falls heavily on a few. Somebody had to do it. I was organized and efficient and had built strong connections across the university, so it might as well be me.</p>

One semester I knew I&#8217;d be asked to serve on both the incredibly time-intensive uber-tenure committee, which reviewed all the other faculty reviews, <em>and </em>to &#8220;co&#8221;-chair, with a preoccupied administrator, a major task force. So, before the invitations even arrived, I said I&#8217;d be willing to do one or the other. I was then, predictably, appointed to both, with the assurance that &#8220;we know you can handle it.&#8221; I had always &#8220;handled it&#8221; before! In my final two years at The New School, amidst the pandemic, I was directing those two programs that bridged three divisions, attending to students and administrative demands across those three divisions, dealing with major family crises (mom&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s and move into memory care, dad&#8217;s grief and worry and, later, cancer), and battling a well known copyright troll (who demanded the equivalent of two years&#8217; salary (!!) because I made *fair use* of a single photo in a class lesson three years prior; TNS expected me to secure my own legal counsel <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). When my first-ever panic attack struck, I asked to step away from one of my administrative roles. Rather then offering meaningful relief, leadership gave me a research assistant.</p>
<p>I had deferred a sabbatical when I was asked to take on these final service roles, and I forfeited that leave when I left The New School. My new employer thus promised to offer me a leave — my first since 2013 — for my initial semester, Spring 2023. I was <em>so </em>ready for my first break in a decade. I was <em>beyond </em>&#8220;running on fumes.&#8221; Yet that &#8220;sabbatical&#8221; was consumed with continued advising at The New School, the work of helping to found a new department at the new place, and, a little over a week into my contract, an unexpected request: on January 10 I was asked to phase in as director of a lab. This responsibility wasn&#8217;t discussed during my negotiations or written into my job contract, and I certainly didn&#8217;t <em>want </em>an administrative role after having just left two — but, again, I felt such pressure to comply.</p>
<p>I was told that only other fitting candidates for the directorship were junior faculty who weren&#8217;t yet eligible. What&#8217;s more, having arrived from a relatively small, tuition-driven school with often-precarious finances, I&#8217;d never before been in close proximity to such immense resources and possibility — and I felt obligated, as someone who&#8217;d lucked into a fancy new position, to seize the opportunity presented to me, and to steward those resources as responsibly and imaginatively as possible. (When you go from having zero dollars to having, potentially, <em>a lot</em>, you take it seriously; thus, I did a ton of homework and lots of &#8220;service mapping.&#8221;) I consulted with a few colleagues, who agreed that we had a great opportunity to reposition the lab and build our new department in complementary fashion. I wanted to make a good first impression and create something exciting for the long haul. Refusing to do so when the opportunity presented itself — however inconvenient the timing — seemed like a bad way to build solidarities.</p>
<p>I could easily dedicate 10,000 words to the calamities that followed: the institutional rifts and wounds I hadn&#8217;t been made aware of, the shifting priorities of past external funding sources, uncertainty about internal funding or long-term administrative interest, confusion about divisions of labor and priorities, the budgetary barriers to inter-division collaboration, campus turmoil, the president&#8217;s ouster, other departures, uncertainty regarding my physical place on campus, additional service requests from across the university, and on and on (many of the same challenges that compelled <em>other</em> colleagues to leave!). I once asked for additional support to help navigate through these converging maelstroms and was told that I would&#8217;ve had to request such accommodations when I negotiated my contract. If only I&#8217;d known <em>then</em> what awaited me.</p>
<p>When more people left and I was recruited to help fill a big gap, I asked for guidance in prioritizing my responsibilities: what did they <em>expect </em>me to focus on? (The underlying, tacit question was: why on earth did you recruit me?!) I was told I&#8217;d need to make those determinations on my own, but that I probably should re-calibrate my service load for my first &#8220;official&#8221; semester on campus. So, I requested permission to step back from a few posts — and in each case, I was told that I wasn&#8217;t expendable because (1) they were short-staffed, (2) I was the only person with relevant experience, or (3) I&#8217;d be jeopardizing staff jobs. I didn&#8217;t create these logistical and staffing problems, yet I was expected to sacrifice <em>myself</em>  as I worked around them and helped to address them.</p>
<p>I had also considered removing myself from a major executive search committee, but that search would determine the future of the lab; this new leader would head the lab&#8217;s joint partner. Plus, as one of only two faculty on the sizable committee — and as someone with expertise in the search area — I felt compelled to contribute. That obligation was also rooted in solidarity with the staff who&#8217;d then work under our chosen executive. I&#8217;d befriended many of those staff — many of whom were depleted and demoralized by the recently-removed leadership, and many of whom were precariously employed on short-term contracts (a concern I raised repeatedly). For the sake of solidarity, I didn&#8217;t refuse. The search process consumed about 100 hours of my first year: a year when I also (I know I&#8217;ve said some of this stuff already; please indulge me; it&#8217;s cathartic) taught all brand-new classes in a brand-new department to a student body vastly different from the one with which I was familiar, when I served on several other committees, when I sought to situate myself on campus without a permanent office (or even a temporary one near my department), when I tried to build new connections despite the absence of any official notice about my arrival. Around me, the campus had erupted in protest, administrators targeted activist faculty, colleagues enjoyed <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/09/penn-cooperation-house-committee-condemned-mesa-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little</a> <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/11/penn-middle-east-center-director-resignation-aaup-israelism-academic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protection</a> from angry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/us/university-of-pennsylvania-israel-palestine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donors</a> and <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-10-21-moral-authority-of-marc-rowan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alums</a> and internet trolls, and <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/12/penn-shared-governance-faculty-criticism-erosion-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faculty governance deteriorated</a>.</p>

<p>I worked <em>all the time — </em>seven days a week — for my first three semesters (&#8230;which, sadly, merely exacerbated a long-standing pattern). Some folks encouraged me to invest less in my teaching. The mounting frustrations, exhaustion, and confusion about why I was there contributed to the psychophysiological turmoil — all interrupted by that blissful week in the hospital.</p>
<p>I was ostensibly recruited for my interdisciplinary research and teaching. I think they wanted me to build something similar in the lab, but without understanding <strong>the <em>labor </em>of working in-between</strong> or the difficulty of doing so as someone who, because of her brand-newness, still didn&#8217;t know what those institutional boundaries or fault-lines were, or how to bridge them (or when I shouldn&#8217;t even <em>try</em>, because disparate divisional cultures and budgets are irreconcilable). As I learned while developing and directing interdisciplinary programs in the past, making connections is <em>work</em>: intellectual, logistical, and affective work — the kind of internal service that doesn&#8217;t readily lend itself to bullet-pointed documentation on a cv. But it&#8217;s also the kind of service I love, and the kind that makes best use of my skills, so it&#8217;s hard to refuse.</p>
<p>Being interdisciplinary means being accountable for the scholarship and practice in multiple fields. And when you do that work well enough to develop credibility in a range of fields, it means taking part in the intellectual community, advising junior scholars, visiting classes, and conducting reviews across multiple fields. A lot of <em>external </em>service. I receive mentorship and review requests — <strong>manuscript reviews, book blurbs, dossier reviews, program reviews, rankings surveys, thesis reviews, studio crits, grant and fellowship selection committees, invitations to junior scholars&#8217; multi-day book manuscript workshops, and so forth</strong> (just look at all those genres of volunteerism!) — from across media studies, information studies, science and technology studies, art, architecture, urban planning, design studies, geography, and anthropology. I&#8217;ve reviewed manuscripts and faculty dossiers in gender studies, disability studies, and English, too, and I&#8217;ve served on selection boards for research centers and funding agencies across the U.S. and in other countries. I typically receive 10 to 20 review requests of various sorts every week; if I were to accept all of them, I&#8217;d be committing myself to 100 or more additional hours of pro bono labor each week. Some opportunities offer to pay a modest honorarium, but my concern isn&#8217;t the money; it&#8217;s the time. I don&#8217;t have it. And thus I must, sadly, refuse the vast majority of those requests.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an additional cost, too: an affective one. I&#8217;ve spoken with several mid-career and senior women colleagues — and many women staff at all career stages — about the <strong>affective weight</strong> of <em>considering </em>the multiple requests that hit our inboxes. Could we squeeze in that review over the holiday? Could we stay up late and churn out that letter? Could we step onto the dissertation committee of a student who&#8217;s been hurt by an abusive mentor? (I&#8217;ve been in this situation more than once.) Could we schedule a quick chat with that undergrad who has to complete an &#8220;expert interview&#8221; for a class assignment at another university? <em>Should </em>we? (I&#8217;ve always had trouble separating the &#8220;could&#8221; from the &#8220;should.&#8221;) My colleagues and I dedicate hours every week to this moral and ethical calculus. Yes, we&#8217;ve all gotten much better at &#8220;saying no,&#8221; but <strong>as the volume of requests increases, as the whole system becomes more and more precarious and dependent upon volunteerism (and a shrinking pool of volunteers, at that!), the cognitive load increases.</strong> And issuing rejections — a lot of them, and often to folks in vulnerable positions: managing editors on short contracts, underpaid staff, students — <em>feels really, really bad</em>. Several colleagues noted that, like me, they carry that weight around with them. And it accumulates.</p>
<p>On two occasions over the past two years, I politely declined to take on faculty reviews for prestigious universities because I had already completed more than my share of such work, only to have administrators return, months later, to ask me to reconsider. Because I wanted to practice solidarity with other women in similar in-between positions — whose unorthodox trajectories might not be clearly legible to more traditional review committees — I caved, taking on yet another service responsibility because everyone else had apparently said no. This past year I dedicated the first two months of my summer to external faculty reviews — eight of them — and letters of recommendation, then spent the equivalent of another few weeks on letters in the fall. In all, I&#8217;ve dedicated about a quarter of my year to letters and reviews (I&#8217;m not even counting here my classroom obligations, including the review of student work!).</p>
<p>I say yes because I want to support my students and colleagues, both faculty and staff. I feel obligated to &#8220;pull my weight,&#8221; to take my turn — but it&#8217;s become increasingly clear to me that, in doing so, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I&#8217;m also propping up and validating a system that is (often artificially) austere, inefficient, exploitative, fetishistically hierarchical, and exclusionary.</strong> </span>Ahmed warned us! The entire academic enterprise, as it&#8217;s currently constructed, depends upon<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> reifying power differentials between ranks and classes</strong></span>, keeping people hungry to advance, cultivating jealousies and resentments, disincentivizing solidarities, manufacturing all kinds of tests and rituals and administrative labor to deem people worthy of advancement. The entire academic enterprise also depends upon these <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>systems of external support and validation</strong></span> — support through external grants, external validation as a means of quality assurance for the purposes of hiring and promotion, external validation as necessary confirmation that one&#8217;s work <em>matters</em> (affirmation we rarely hear at our home institutions!) — <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet the distributed, voluntary labor required to sustain those infrastructures isn&#8217;t written into most folks&#8217; job descriptions.</strong></span> You rarely know when the requests are coming, so you can&#8217;t plan for them. There&#8217;s no transparency regarding broad distributions of labor, so you never know when you&#8217;ve &#8220;done your share.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not as if your university clears the decks at home when you need to travel to conduct an external program review or participate on a funder&#8217;s review panel. Our institutional leaders need volunteers from <em>other</em> institutions to perform this work for <em>us </em>and <em>our faculty and staff</em>, yet nobody thinks to create space for an economy of reciprocation. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The whole thing is a supplemental gift economy that bolsters the industry&#8217;s bad business models and management practices.</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>We fill in the gaps of an unstable apparatus we didn&#8217;t design and would rather reform or abolish — that is, raze and <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/abolition-as-method/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace with new systems prioritizing freedom and abundance</a>. We <em>should</em> engage in service to support faculty and staff colleagues in more precarious positions — yet it was those above our pay grade who <em>created </em>and <em>cemented </em>that precarity by neoliberalizing the institution, shifting toward casualized labor, and bowing to partisan billionaire donors. Faculty and staff didn&#8217;t consolidate academic scholarship into the hands of a few rapacious commercial publishers, yet we&#8217;re obligated to donate our labor and expertise to review and edit the scholarship those publishers obtain for free (or for a fee!), which they then resell to our own institutions for massive profits — simply because we want to promote the creation and distribution of knowledge, <em>and </em>because we want to support the work of folks who <em>need </em>that external validation in order to get and keep their jobs. It&#8217;s all a bit Ponzi-esque! And we&#8217;ve naturalized so many ideologically and economically inconsistent systems like this! One more example: the whole Recommendation Letter Industrial Complex — it&#8217;s bonkers! And none of it has to be like this!</p>

<p>It’s not just a matter of learning to say no. I <em>refuse refusal</em> as a means of survival within a system that has turned refusal itself into one of its conceptual products, and which, because of its dependence upon limitless, voluntary affective labor, renders refusal — when performed by particular subordinate subjects – as a kind of neglect. Okay, that sounds obnoxious. In other words, the academy finds ways both to capitalize on &#8220;refusal&#8221; as a theory, and to penalize it in practice. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t do this, you&#8217;re hurting the staff. We reify this hierarchy so we can motivate you through a sense of ethical obligation.&#8221; So many of the tasks to which we&#8217;re recruited feel pointless anyway — a performance of engagement or simulacrum of faculty governance. I&#8217;ve served on so many task forces, engaged in so many weekend retreats, only to submit a kick-ass report or proposal that immediately disappears into the void. Some institutions (ahem) assemble expansive, expensive, incredibly time intensive, international search committees for high-level leadership. So many of those searches then result in internal hires. How much time have we all dedicated to projects that are essentially <em><span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">faits accomplis</span></span>?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had so little time or mental capacity to do any of the things I’m ostensibly good at, the things for which I&#8217;m uniquely qualified. So much of my brain space has been consumed with the affective and logistical labor created by a cruel, dysfunctional, unsustainable system. A year ago my body made the executive decision to perform a definitive, non-negotiable form of refusal. And my gut has convinced my mind that my <em>failure </em>to refuse, over the years, has indeed made me a &#8220;good&#8221; teacher and university citizen — but it&#8217;s also propped up institutions suffering their own forms of ethical and teleological sepsis. My own belated and futile acts of refusal won&#8217;t save the academy. The academy itself needs surgery, a moral reckoning, an abolitionist re-haul. I know a guy who could loan us an excavator.</p>
<p>[Finally: yes, this is a trite theme. That&#8217;s why I posted it on my own blog rather that assuming it was even remotely &#8220;publication-worthy&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I had to write it for myself, and I&#8217;ll be glad if it has any value for others.]</p>

<h3>CODA</h3>
<p>I ran out of time and energy to address possible remedies. I know various organizations and collectives are working on reform and abolition. I&#8217;ll also note that the last class I taught at The New School, in 2022, was &#8220;<a href="https://redesigningacademy.wordsinspace.net/spring2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning the Academy</a>,&#8221; a graduate workshop in which we engaged with critical university studies and related work from other fields — sociology and anthropology of education, media education, Black and feminist studies, service design, etc — then imagined how things could be otherwise. It was such a cathartic and hopeful experience. The scholarship and experimental practices in this course offer many potential directions forward. I think all the academy&#8217;s reformers and abolitionists need an opportunity for collective diagnosis, catharsis, and imagining. We can build something better.</p>

<p>After having been party to maybe 300 (?) faculty evaluations — writing &#8220;chairs reports&#8221; for contingent faculty; chairing or serving on internal committees; assessing the fairness of others&#8217; committees; evaluating dossiers for other institutions&#8217; tenure, recruitment, and promotion-to-full reviews, etc — I&#8217;ve been struck, with increasing intensity, by how little effort is typically expended in documenting one&#8217;s commitment to teaching and its value. Sometimes, all I see is a list of classes on a cv or a few sample syllabi, which, however brilliant (or not) they might look on paper, must be <em>activated </em>in the classroom.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve dedicated the major part of my working hours to teaching, advising, and mentoring; I&#8217;ve taught close to 100 sections of 40 different classes, all of my own design, and advised about 70 graduate theses and dissertations. I&#8217;ve sought to share all of <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my teaching material</a>, and (with their permission!) much of my students&#8217; work, on this website. Now, as I reflect on a quarter century of interactions with students and advisees, and as I witness widespread attacks on higher education and attempts to automate the human work of teaching and learning, I wanted to allow my students to explain, in their own words, not only <em>the value of teaching</em>, but also <em>my skills as a teacher.</em></p>
<p>I’ve consistently received excellent teaching evaluations, yet I&#8217;m also well aware that teaching evaluations are an imperfect measure of teaching excellence — and, furthermore, that &#8220;excellence&#8221; itself is often operationalized in problematic ways! Nevertheless, the Likert scales suggest I&#8217;m doing okay. I was also awarded, in 2011, The New School’s Distinguished University Teaching Award. (I was nominated several times, but one can win only once!) Students commonly express appreciation for my <b>organization, knowledge, enthusiasm, and accessibility</b>; for my ability to <b>clearly explain complex texts and topics</b>; for my skill in <b>leading inclusive and engaging discussions</b>; and for the <b>thoroughness, promptness, and helpfulness of my feedback</b>.</p>
<p>I’ll share a few student comments from across the past decade+ of evaluations: A student in my Fall 2012 "Urban Media Archaeology" class described me as “<b>Thorough. Enthusiastic. Open-minded. Challenging. Up-to-date. </b>Shannon really pushes you to do your best. And <strong>you want to do your best because you know that SHE’s doing HER best</strong>.” Many students have referred to a variety of my classes as “the best class [they’ve] taken in the program” – or at institution, or anywhere. A student in my Fall 2013 “Archives, Libraries, and Databases” class wrote: “I feel so lucky to have had Shannon as a teacher. She manages to<b> explain every concept with much clarity</b> and always provides references and <b>examples of creative applications</b> of the various subjects we talk about. She facilitates discussions in an effortless invisible way so <b>almost everyone participates</b> and shares their thoughts. Her <b>feedback on student work is helpful and insightful</b>. We often <b>laugh together</b> in class, how wonderful is that?” A Fall 2016 “Maps as Media” student wrote: “Her interactions with students were <b>helpful and respectful.</b> There were diverse students from different backgrounds, and she was <b>fair with all the students</b> <strong>including international students.</strong> She tried to communicate with people who are not used to this academic domain and <b>considered carefully… each student’s interest</b>.” A Spring 2017 “Urban Intelligence” student said: “Shannon is one of the most amazing professors that I’ve ever met. She is not only <b>clever, but also very organized, helpful, respectful, responsible, and motivating.</b> She is absolutely THE BEST.” I’m particularly heartened by comments I received in Fall 2020, after a full semester on Zoom. One student, echoing many of her classmates, wrote: “[Shannon] sets a <b>respectful, supportive, and generous tone</b> that students pick up on and reflect back to one another. She <b>makes it clear that we can critique out of love and kindness</b>, and that working to be better than we have been (both individually and within our fields and institutions) is a form of care and deep engagement. Shannon <b>works harder and more thoughtfully</b> than any other professor I have taken, and her <b>rigor and high standards for herself</b> inspire students to do incredible, and <b>risk-taking, work.</b> Her <b>feedback is helpful, kind</b>, and above all deeply thoughtful. It feels amazing for someone so brilliant to take the time to really engage with my work, and it truly motivates me to push myself.”</p>
<p>My teaching received a great deal of positive attention from across The New School, where I was regularly invited to give guest lectures in colleagues’ classes, to serve as a guest critic in their studios, and to teach across the university’s divisions (I&#8217;m still not quite sure how I fit in at Penn?). My courses have also resonated beyond my home institutions — thanks in no small part to my class websites. I’ve been invited to offer master classes and pedagogy workshops from Amsterdam to Seoul. My courses have also drawn a variety of external auditors — from library administrators to celebrated poets to university staff members — who’ve greatly enriched our discussions.</p>
<p>Yet what matters most to me is the longitudinal feedback — the &#8220;outcomes&#8221; that manifest in students&#8217; lives a semester, or a decade, after the final grades are in. The non-compulsory check-in or note of appreciation that pops up in my inbox long after graduation. The classroom rapport that develops, over years, into a collaboration or a friendship. The testimonial shared with the dean. The shout-out on an alumni panel.</p>
<h3>I&#8217;ll share a sample of the informal, voluntary comments I&#8217;ve received over the years — through email, through posts on social media, through letters submitted to supervisors and passed along to me — and which, I think, best capture my character as a teacher, advisor, and mentor [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6m4Qo_1iV9dSsQ1BJEQtUkPZ_B2mxN3Qm8qursjOOY/edit?usp=sharing">here&#8217;s the long list, </a>which is itself drawn from a small sample of the correspondence I&#8217;ve saved over the past 20 years]:</h3>
<p>From a 2007 testimonial sent to the dean by a former student and 2006 thesis advisee: “To this day, and as someone who has continued my academic pursuits [in another masters program], <b>I have not encountered a more thoughtful and responsive professor. In fact, it is highly unlikely that I will. </b>Shannon’s prompt responses to my coursework were astoundingly comprehensive and thought-provoking. Her attention to detail included not only the theoretical aspects of the work, but also the scholarly and professional realm as she strove to help students become better writers and understand the <b>various avenues for sharing our work outside of the classroom</b>. Shannon has the highly unusual trait of being <b>both an effective and instructive professor and an extremely intriguing scholar</b>. I often marveled at her ability to fulfill both roles so seemingly effortlessly – though I know that her dedication to working tirelessly is the actual truth. In this respect, her influence as an example was immensely important to me as a nascent scholar.” That same student wrote again, years later, as she wrapped up her thesis in her subsequent graduate program: “<b>Your research and thesis student resources have been extremely helpful. I have even sent them to some of my classmates and they’ve been raving about this magical Shannon Mattern at The New School. </b><b>That you put those resources out into the universe for not only your students and your former students, but for… well, anyone… is so gracious and awesome.</b>”</p>
<p>From a former dean, after a 2013 alumni event: “While many faculty were mentioned by name by the alumni on the panel this evening, <b>YOU were mentioned by nearly every one of them specifically as the faculty member who made a significant impact on their learning / lives while at SMS. </b><b>Your generosity of time, intellectual guidance, and moral support</b> were mentioned more than once. I wish you could have heard it for yourself&#8230;.BUT we have it on tape! So wonderful to hear, so wonderful to work with you in the context of SMS!”</p>
<p>A 2012 email from a former thesis advisee: “<b>All the chatting, advising </b>(during my MA but even more so since),<b> helping me plan my adjunct classes</b> by offering massive lists of references,<b> visiting those classes as a guest critic, </b><b>offering me opportunities to TA and insisting on treating it as “co-teaching,” introducing me to so many other valuable contacts — all of these have made me feel like a colleague and a friend as much as a student</b>, and it has really given me the <b>confidence and support to feel like I can succeed in this path.</b> More than any of my other profs, <b>you always offer such genuine care, concern and support. </b>And that consistent and ongoing support really has helped make my success possible.”</p>
<p>A 2014 email from a former student and thesis advisee who went on to pursue a PhD in Denmark: “As I am trying to make my mind understand that I just left New York and my life there, I want to thank you deeply for having inspired me and stirred changes that have brought me to a completely different place than I was five years ago. Yes, I do have to credit you a lot for this, <b>you kind of opened my eyes.</b> I am confused right now about re-integrating in Copenhagen, but <b>I am forever grateful that I am returning with a completely different toolbox and set of ideas, and capacity to realize them. I would never have dared to pursue all this without you as a role model.</b> So thank you, Shannon.”</p>
<p>A 2022 Twitter message from a 2018 student: “I wrote two pieces in your classes that I felt really proud of, and <b>you gave me such positive and supportive feedback that it really helped me as someone with… a debilitating lack of self-confidence.</b> I have read your articles/book since I graduated…, and I am such a fan of your scholarship. Without being mawkish, <b>your email saying you enjoyed my (illustrated essay) is something I return to when I feel defeated, just because I never really had anyone in my education or career tell me that I had anything worthwhile to say</b><b>.</b> So, [I offer] very sincere thanks…”</p>
<p>From a non-traditional student who took several of my classes between 2005 and 2007: “One of the first things to which I credit Shannon was how <strong>she</strong> <b>helped me transition from the world of business,[ where I worked for 30 years], to that of the humanities. Her enthusiasm for her subjects and the seriousness with which she pursued her vocation</b> was irresistible and infectious, and I began to think in ways I had not in many years. As [an advisor] of my thesis, Shannon made a close reading of my work, and <b>the astuteness of her comments made me a more attentive reader, and more disciplined thinker – in short, a better student</b>. The time and effort she gave me as I wrote and revised and revised again went far beyond anything I expected and probably deserved.”</p>
<p>From a TA who worked with me in our 200-student “Understanding Media Studies” lecture class in 2009: “<b>Shannon is hands down one of the most intelligent, thoughtful, and dedicated Professors that I have worked with in my time at the New School, and indeed, throughout my academic career</b><b>. She is truly vibrant in the classroom and expresses a passion for and mastery of her subject matter. </b>Her course was <b>superbly and meticulously crafted</b> to allow for students to develop essential skills for [graduate study], while at the same time allowing them to come into contact with sophisticated theoretical concepts and ideas…. She was <b>always available to answer any questions or concerns [from her TAs], and expressed a genuine trust in my judgment and input.</b> This only added to the tremendous respect I already had for her as a scholar and teacher.” From another TA in the same semester: “Working under Shannon was the <b>single most important pedagogical experience I have had and has changed the way I think about preparation, organization, and managing a class</b>.”</p>
<p>A 2012 email from an advisee who had just attended his first academic conference, after I’d helped him apply and prepare: “So, before the post-conference swoon wears off I just wanted to write to say thanks for everything &#8211; <b>sharing the call with me and encouraging me to apply and helping me to apply and talking through all that stuff and helping me get in</b> (even if just by association) and I think if you weren&#8217;t there being supportive I would&#8217;ve completely lost my shit :)&#8230; I do feel like <b>all these little achievements are really just the result of absorbing and emulating as much as possible from you and everyone else in our program</b> that I’ve been able to work with. Soo, thanks for <b>being so encouraging and giving me all these opportunities</b> and putting up with all my scattered and disorganized ways of dealing with things <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A 2008 letter from an adjunct online faculty member with whom I worked as her program director: “The long stretch of both the virtual classroom and academic department was successfully breached by Shannon’s adept and unique administrative approach. <b>I could not have maintained this position without her. </b>This innovative pedagogical model <b>requires a strong, supportive, engaged and responsive administrator in the department to connect with the myriad far-flung faculty </b>(including roughly 40 adjuncts scattered across the globe, plus 20 full-time faculty). Shannon fulfilled those requirements beyond any I have encountered as an adjunct, whether onsite or online.</p>
<p>A 2021 message from a scholar in Bangkok: “I’m writing you from Bangkok, Thailand, to express my appreciation and support for your work, and, more importantly, your work ethic… <b>Your class contents and references </b>prioritizing polarizing arrays of people, places, and priorities <b>are empowering. I just wanted to let you know that there are people who are moved by what you do. I get excited looking at your course [websites].</b> They are truly motivating.”</p>
<p>An email from an undergraduate student in my 2021 graduate “Design Ethnography Workshop” class: “<b>I felt a bit intimidated at first being one of the few undergrads there, and since I&#8217;ve never taken a 4000 level class before, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect.</b> I&#8217;m happy to hear that my teammates appreciated my contributions to our report, and thank you for all of your help along the way! <b>I&#8217;ve gained so much from this class, and it&#8217;s been one of my favorite anthropology classes I&#8217;ve taken so far!</b> I loved all of the collaborative work, and I hope there are more classes like this in the future! <b>Thank you for being such an amazing professor as always</b>!” From a graduate student in the class: “Now that [you have submitted grades] I can speak more freely to say that <b>you are a truly extraordinary teacher</b>&#8230;. Many professors seem more engaged in their research and other projects, which they probably have to due to pressures to make a name for themselves&#8230; I know that you do that and probably much more but <b>you still prioritize teaching. To us students, that makes all the difference. I have also heard many good things about you in [my home] department</b>, so you may be getting more of us in the future :)” An email from another graduate student: “I just wanted to tell you that <b>you are doing an amazing job with this course that you designed for us. It is impressive to see how you organize the information, the materials for each session, and how, every Thursday, everything progresses and makes sense. This happens because you manage to articulate our ideas with yours in an admirable way, </b><b>you give shape to this experiment, making us feel like we are going to a good place</b> in the midst of uncertainty.” And from another student: “Thank you so much for the feedback. Before I respond, <b>I just wanted to acknowledge how exceptional I&#8217;ve found your thoughtful approach to planning and executing this course. </b><b>You seem to truly care about our learning, ability to access course materials and one another, our understanding of the purpose and goals of each session, and the outcomes we hope to achieve as individual learners. I&#8217;ve rarely experienced a professor so profoundly caring and am consistently amazed by your availability</b> over email and the efficiency with which you operate. You are an amazing teacher and I am really enjoying this course :)”</p>
<p>A 2022 Twitter message from an academic librarian: “It’s really meant a lot to me meeting you on here. <b>Your kindness and encouragement to young scholars and those outside of traditional structures is very widely known and appreciated</b>.”</p>
<p>A 2023 email from a New School graduate student who completed her dissertation before I joined the Anthropology department, and thus before I had an opportunity to meet her: “<b>As people no doubt tell you all the time, your twitter is an absolute beacon in an otherwise very murky, overwhelming academic world (and world).</b> You posted the advertisement for the position at Colby College, which was the first job description I ever read that I thought I was perhaps remotely viable for. I applied, got the campus interview, gave the job talk…. <b>Thank you for the tremendous generosity of your public presence and the efforts you make to distribute resources and opportunities</b>.”</p>
<p>A student from my 2022 “Redesigning the Academy” class, the last class I taught at The New School, emailed me to say: “This class was an<b> absolute highlight of my Parsons experience and it is exactly what I needed to help keep my motivation up and to help try to make things better</b> — continuously.” Another wrote: “<b>I&#8217;ve learned so much from you, through the course materials and through your pedagogy. I only wish one day I could be as good a teacher as you</b> are to my students to match up with your <b>incredible work ethic </b>and your invaluable contributions, not only to the field of humanities and social sciences but <b>to this higher education system as a whole</b>. You are <b>truly a role model for everyone here at TNS. I know it&#8217;s not just me but this is a strong feeling shared by every student who comes into contact with you</b>.” Another student from the same class wrote: “I wanted to thank you for <b>being a great professor and designing and teaching such interesting classes.</b> Starting from the latter: the <b>reflexive and nuanced way your classes manage the tensions that emerge when intersecting different disciplines</b>&#8230; is really something that I benefited from, helping me (someone [with] a background in finance&#8230; who is doing a MA in anthropology) to explore both the disciplinary blind spots as well as the sometimes conflicting and sometimes extremely generative possibilities of synergy. Now from the former: I think that <b>the level of care and attentiveness you put into your classes and into our (students) particular learning processes is unrivaled</b> probably in the whole NSSR. It is really something that touches us. TNS has clearly lost a lot with your departure. It was a pleasure being your student for the past year.” Another shared via email: “<b>It is a rare experience, I have found, to encounter a professor like you.</b> I am very thankful to be in your class this semester and to have you as my advisor.”</p>
<p>After I left The New School, in 2022, a PhD student at the New School for Social Research — someone with whom I hadn’t interacted during my time at TNS — wrote me to say: “Since this is my first opportunity in my correspondence with you, let me just start by saying thank you. For two very particular reasons: (one) <b>Your website is a goldmine</b>; it inspired and continues to inspire not only me and my work but arguably and more importantly, my pedagogical approach. Ever since being introduced to it, <b>I have borrowed ways of teaching, reorienting my slides to be simpler and more graphical, implemented stuff like &#8220;alternate forms of participation&#8221;</b> in all my classes and alongside an &#8220;ecology of knowledge&#8221; approach (Katherine Hayles), I believe (and hope) it serves my students well. (two) <b>your body of work opened up my imaginary</b> as to what kinds of rigorous and yet pertinent and accessible scholarships were possible. Again, <b>this bleeds into my own teaching; I teach your articles</b> on &#8220;Maintenance and Care&#8221; and &#8220;The Spectacle of Data&#8221; as important elements in my Open Source Software class, for example&#8230; The above is all true but I would be lying if I insisted that this email was ALL precipitated on the back of pure altruism and solidarity. It has a selfish component which I am coming to. Outside of your own scholarship, <b>I also heard of fantastic things from colleagues who were in your classes and were mentored by you</b>, and I guess my disappointment is that I was unable to associate with you.”</p>
<p>A 2024 email from a New School graduate and a current doctoral student at another institution: “I admire your work and always find incredible inspiration in reading and learning from you. <b>Although I never took a class with you—something I always regret—I remember your comments when you attended the exhibitions and student sessions at the [Transdisciplinary Design] program at Parsons.</b> Today, I am writing my dissertation [and serving as a lecturer at MIT]. I have to say <b>I have learned a lot from your syllabus and pedagogy. </b>I am hopefully honoring your legacy on maps and other media.  …I just wanted to say hello and say <b>you are a genuine model of the kind of professor and academic I will always aspire to be. </b>With no other further thing to say: thank you.”</p>
<p>A very quiet student from my 2023 &#8220;Cinema and Media Studies Methods&#8221; class — the first class I taught at Penn — wrote me after the semester to say: &#8220;<b>I liked that everyone was being supportive, friendly, and open to opinions</b>, and <b>I felt safe expressing myself, to exchanging intellectual ideas</b>; this is something that I have missed from school, <b>to express yourself even if you may be wrong</b> is something less common when I stepped out of school, in[to] the “real world.’ I appreciate <b>how engaging the class was</b>, the field trips, the guests, and the informal dinner with the professors. I also appreciated <b>how responsive you were and the detailed feedback you provided</b>, and that you have <b>constantly asked for feedback from us. </b>Not trying to defame anyone here, but this is in contrast to many of my personal experiences: a lot of professors don’t reply to emails, barely grade assignments on time, and provide almost no feedback until the end of the semester.” Still another student wrote: “This semester has been a <b>fantastic journey of learning from you. I had no idea an academic &#8220;methods class&#8221; could be so engaging.</b> I&#8217;ve learned a lot of new ideas about how to think about methods and approach them, which is fantastic!” And yet another said: “Thank you so much for your very <b>thoughtful and detailed feedback!</b> I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for a wonderful semester. I really appreciated the time and effort that went into tailoring topics to our interests and providing <b>multiple opportunities for great feedback</b>.”</p>
<p>A student from my Fall 2024 class wrote to comment on a term that arose repeatedly in our class discussions: &#8220;capacious.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I love that the word itself combines in its shades of meaning qualities of holding, understanding, and doing. Or, if I’m riffing, the space to care, to learn, and to act&#8230;. That’s also how I feel about the experience of learning with you and of the space that you stewarded. It was <strong>rich and full, clear and open, vast and grounded. And it felt – I felt – so cared for (and inspired!)</strong> through the frameworks, models, and modes that you set up for and with us. Thank you for all of that time, consideration, and labor!&#8221; Another wrote: &#8220;Your <strong>care, support, and dedication to enacting the very epistemological and ethical values you embodied in your work</strong> created an unparalleled classroom environment — one I already find myself missing — predicated on <strong>understanding, community, and kindness.</strong> It is rare to find a class that so fundamentally alters your conception of a given subject, much less reconceive the very enterprise in which academia engages (and the apparatus of which it is a part). Rarer still is it to find <strong>a course that truly, indelibly moves you</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>In Summer 2024, as I prepared a teaching and mentoring dossier for some new public pedagogy projects, I created a web form where anyone who&#8217;d engaged with and somehow benefited from my teaching or teaching materials could share their thoughts. Here&#8217;s what some folks — students, dissertation advisees, postdocs, long-term faculty and staff colleagues, acquaintances, strangers — said:</h3>
<p>Comments from a 2020-2021 teaching assistant, advisee, and article co-author: “Shannon’s contributions as a scholar, educator, and mentor are profound. <b>As her TA for two semesters, I saw up close the care and creativity she puts into preparing her classes and how that translates into an unparalleled student experience</b> — one that both <b>directly responds to the interests and experiences of students</b> and also provides <b>outlets to explore, write, and experiment capaciously through generative assignments and moments for substantive feedback from both Shannon and other classmates</b>. I regularly find myself<b> referring back to her thoroughly researched open syllabi for the classes I TA’ed (and also those I did not!)</b> when looking for readings, links to digital projects, assignments, or inspiration for a topic I’m working on. <b>Finding yourself in a “Shannon class” typically meant sitting next to students from a dozen majors</b> and the semester was a masterclass in <b>developing strategies for communicating across and bridging different disciplines.</b> Her classes are as much a<b> collective journey for all involved</b>, with Shannon serving as a generous guide and approachable resource, rather than a “sage on a stage.&#8221; Both Shannon’s work and Shannon herself are [respected] by scholars, artists, and professionals working across the fields of media studies, architecture, art history, urban planning, and library and information science, demonstrated most notably by the<b> enthusiastic guest speakers who accepted her invitations and brought new perspectives to our class experience.</b> In short: <b>taking a class with Shannon is an example of the best of what higher education can be, largely because she models so many of the practices that make a learning environment generative, welcoming, and motivating</b>.”</p>
<p>Comments from a long-term New School colleague: “Dr. Mattern&#8217;s<b> innovative pedagogy has been a model and inspiration to me and to so many of my colleagues across an expansive disciplinary range</b> &#8211; from studio arts to media studies to anthropology, information studies, cultural studies, design, and more. Her critically informed and <b>reflective approach to sharing and principled advocacy for open access</b> to knowledge has served as an ethical compass for my own teaching practice.”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2021 student: “As graduate student at TNS outside of the Anthropology Department who originally signed up for the class as an “interesting elective,” the Anthro &amp; Design Course was <b>one of the most impactful and insightful times</b> in my studies. In an extremely difficult and isolating year in academia [amidst] COVID and remote learning,<b> your intentionality in creating a community agreement and fostering a welcoming environment, even through screens, </b>produced such wonderful, respectful, and brilliant student relationships and feedback loops. I specifically <b>appreciate your organization and time spent laying out class materials</b> and student work on your website. The course topics and <b>time spent workshopping materials with your editing</b> completely <b>shifted my approach to my thesis and re-inspired my writing</b>, support I was missing from my own department. I gleaned so much from your lectures as well as your mentorship via the work and presentation of my fellow classmates. Not only on the literal course material and fascinating relationships between anthropology and design, but a larger learning of effective pedagogy via class activities that has <b>heavily influenced my approach to my upcoming first time teaching adjunct</b> media studies.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, thesis advisee, and current faculty at another institution: “Shannon is an incredibly generative and engaged teacher and advisor.<b> The depth (and pedagogical transparency!) of her syllabi is something that I have sought to practice myself</b> (I am nowhere near Shannon&#8217;s level in this!) &#8230; During my time at the New School, our classes regularly <b>found ourselves outside the classroom… as we looked at how learning happens in the world</b>, which was a meaningful and powerful gesture at bridging between academia and public engagement. As a thesis advisor, she was patient, supportive, and a generously thorough reader. I think that <b>part of Shannon’s unique talent is how synthetic her writing i</b>s (this is why there are always Shannon Mattern texts on my syllabi). She is a<b> prolific looker / gatherer / reader / question-asker</b> and brings together a wide array of ideas, objects, buildings, artworks, and other examples &#8230; and weaves them into incredibly thoughtful and accessible texts. All of this has been extremely meaningful for my own approach to writing, teaching, and interdisciplinary inquiry!”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2020-21 student: “Shannon’s guidance as a mentor is (and has consistently been) purely and wonderfully generative! Her ability to <b>inspire question-asking, horizon-broadening, and micro-cum-macro-seeing</b> made my work during grad school — and certainly the way I approach community engagement, research, and design now that I’ve graduated — more self-assured and inclusive. Anymore, <b>the way I ask questions (of an idea, a challenge, a person) has shifted in that an answer may no longer just be means to an end but another opportunity to learn</b>, another chance to explore information. <b>I have never felt so encouraged by a professor or teacher — Shannon&#8217;s curiosity and excitement for learning</b> are contagious and I’m a better designer and advocate because of her impact.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student (2011-12) and capstone advisee: “Shannon Mattern’s skills and impact as a teacher and advisor are truly remarkable. She’s incredibly <b>hands-on, making sure every student feels engaged and supported.</b> Her enthusiasm for the subject and passion for teaching create a classroom environment that’s both inspiring and motivating. Shannon’s <b>strong work ethic and deep knowledge</b> make her a standout educator who really cares about her students’ learning. <b>Even years after taking her classes, I still remember how much I enjoyed them.</b> <b>She’s not just a great teacher but also someone who builds lasting, personal connections with her students, </b>making a big impact both in the short term and long after the class is over.”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2012-13 postdoctoral advisee: “<b>I&#8217;m 43 years old. I&#8217;ve gained two PhDs, held more than fifty university courses, published several books,</b> and developed extensive digital projects. I’m mentioning this to emphasize that I’ve quite some experience in the academic world. In this journey, <b>Shannon was my most important teacher. </b><b>She taught me new ways of doing media studies, of conceptualizing digital projects, and of combining state-of-the art research with teaching.</b> Apart from being an <b>inspiring scholar and teacher</b>, she is also an exemplary <b>humble and lovable person</b> whom I&#8217;m proud to call a friend. The only critical thing that I can say about her is that she works too much, actually so much that the rest of us look lazy next to her <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2023 student and university librarian: <b>&#8220;The way I think about and practice reading, writing, research methods, the structure of my consultations, the communication of my transdisciplinary work, and the estimation of the value of my work has fundamentally been rewired </b>by my interactions with Shannon. She has a unique way of <b>making sense of structures in flux and extending her empathy in tangible ways. </b>The sense of <b>solidarity and camaraderie that I personally feel with her as a queer woman of colour international scholar </b>in the alternative academy is something I truly cherish. Thank you Shannon!”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and co-instructor: “Shannon’s <b>commitment to expansive, critical, meaningful, rigorous, and joyful pedagogy</b> is an inspiration. Shannon <b>teaches in multiple modalities</b>, each one beautifully thought out and researched. Each week in her syllabi includes a long list of supplemental material for anyone wishing to dig deeper into a subject. She provides <b>material from multiple disciplines and cultures of knowledge</b> in a variety of media. She assigns <b>projects that invite creativity, fun, research, and integration of personal knowledge, experience, and curiosity</b>. In the classroom, Shannon <b>holds a caring space,</b> where she fosters a <b>group culture of mutual support and excitement</b> around not only the subject matter, but people&#8217;s individual interests and work as well. She is <b>always prepared, has a wealth of references and knowledge both contemporary and historical, and facilitates discussions with great energy and ease.</b> In all of the classes that I took with her, Shannon had <b>organized field trips that strengthened my connection to knowledge preservation,</b> knowledge production, and cultural production in New York City. Shannon is <b>proof that incredible and important work can take plan across disciplines</b>, both in academia and outside of it. Shannon is<b> one of the most impactful educators I have ever met. </b>I draw on her practice, experience, and wisdom every time I teach, learn, write, or make art.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and research assistant: “Without exaggeration,<b> you remain my north star in terms of pedagogy and public scholarship,</b> and I owe *so much* to your support over the past several years. Though my ‘unorthodox’ and meandering path into academia/research often <b>left me vulnerable to imposter syndrome in graduate school, your attentive guidance and constructive feedback</b> during that time always made me feel like my efforts and contributions as an RA/student were meaningful. Your intellectual and personal generosity gave me <b>confidence to pursue opportunitie</b>s I may not have otherwise felt qualified for—and I know for a fact that <b>your co-sign has impacted other peoples’ decisions to take a chance on me.</b> I could truly write many more words about your impact on my career and general disposition toward research and education (and would be happy to, if it’s useful!), but for the sake of brevity here, I can conclude by maintaining that you are a <b>brilliant scholar and an incredibly kind person</b>, and that (rare) combination of qualities comes across so clearly in your teaching, advising and research/writing.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, dissertation advisee, research advisee, and co-author: &#8220;I have learned and gained so much from my work with Shannon. <b>Her classes were incredibly informative and engaging</b>, but beyond Shannon’s mentorship during the PhD application process and in the early stages of my PhD <b>made me more confident as a scholar.</b> I have also always deeply appreciated her <b>generosity to her students.</b> <b>As her RA, she brought me into her research, </b><b>taking me with her to interviews and making me feel like a collaborator.</b> <b>We later did write a piece together</b> (with the incredible Emily Bowe). <b>Shannon is one of few professors I’ve had who welcomed my input as a student on equal footing</b>, and who invited me (and others) into projects and publishing.</p>
<p>Comments from a former student, teaching assistant, and web designer: “Reflecting on my two years of graduate studies at The New School and my years as a service designer for the government, several people have significantly influenced my growth as a practitioner, teacher, and individual. Among them, Shannon stands out. First, <b>Shannon’s impact extended beyond her own programs.</b> She <b>actively contributed as a guest speaker, advisor, and collaborator across various New School programs.</b> Her efforts to bridge disciplines and overcome silos have inspired me to adopt a <b>similar approach in my work with the federal government</b>, where I strive to break down bureaucratic barriers to effect meaningful change. Second, <b>Shannon fostered learning environments that nurtured </b><b>curiosity, collaboration, and genuine learning.</b> Her courses were relevant and engaging, <b>encouraging diverse perspectives and innovative combinations of methodologies and theories.</b> I aim to emulate Shannon’s teaching style and ability to craft these engaging learning environments in my work, creating environments that promote learning and curiosity while working towards shared goals. Finally,<b> Shannon exemplifies values I aspire to embody. She brings joy to those around her, appreciates diverse perspectives and strengths, supports everyone in their work, is optimistic about the future, and is always open to learn new ways of looking at the world.</b> I am incredibly fortunate to have her as a mentor, teacher, friend!”</p>
<p>Comments from a literature faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>Your teaching has truly opened up new vistas for me</b> &#8211; <b>the way you </b><b>model pedagogy that is interdisciplinary and capacious</b><b>, your ability to design assignments that are creative and rigorous, and your </b><b>modeling of talking about teaching in public</b> have really impacted my own pedagogy. I also have <b>a colleague who was inspired by your local media class to develop a similar class situated in her own geographical and institutional context</b>.”</p>
<p>Comments from a design faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>I incorporate material Shannon’s generously shared and meticulously curated and annotated </b><b>open-access resources</b> – in particular the Are.na collections “Manuals+Guides,” “Sensory Maps” and “Redaction Aesthetics,” but many others – in my undergraduate and Honours level teaching in the Visual Communication program at the University of Technology Sydney. In addition, <b>I use Shannon as a example of the kind of scholar I&#8217;d like my Higher Degree Students (PhD and MA in Design) to become</b> – many students come into academia from a professional creative practice, and have concerns about dedicating much of their time writing for publications that are inaccessible to practice, by journal pay-walls and books with extremely high price-points. <b>Shannon&#8217;s open access, inclusive approach to sharing her scholarship and pedagogy is an inspiration</b> to these students, and myself and colleagues in the field of Design research.”</p>
<p>Comments from a former student and dissertation advisee: “The course I took with Shannon as a PhD student was an important intellectual experience for me, but the biggest long-term impact of the course was the way it <b>opened up what university teaching could look like</b>. As I’ve subsequently gone on to design and teach undergraduate courses myself, I have drawn heavily on many, many things I observed in that one semester: <b>ways of facilitating authentic connections between students, ways of structuring classroom time, ways of sharing and using external resources effectively; ways of drawing everyone’s voice into the discussion, ways of balancing critique and constructive engagement.</b> <b>The care and intention put into that course’s design was miles above the baseline </b>I had come to expect, and it inspired me to get excited about my own teaching in new ways. Through teaching and advising,<b> she is also always seeding new networks of collaborators, intuitively sensing which people and organizations would want to know about or be exposed to which other people or organizations</b>. Several times in the past five years of knowing and working with her,<b> she has suggested a contact, reference, or interlocutor </b>who was exactly who I needed to know about at a given moment in time. This has been great for me individually, but also <b>bespeaks a deep commitment to understanding the place of her teaching in the arc of students’ learning, and to furthering conversations between different academic fields, industry, and public service work. </b></p>
<p>Comments from a 2021-22 student: “I had followed your writing and open course materials for years before finally getting the opportunity to study with you. When I did, I was surprised and <b>happy to learn that you bring the same care, brilliance, omnivorousness, and capaciousness to your teaching. Through course materials and one-on-one discussions, you introduced me to ideas, artworks, and texts that brought depth and rigor to my own research and artwork</b>, and continue to influence me strongly. You encouraged me to pursue hybrid, interdisciplinary work that I struggled to find a home for. <b>As I started my own teaching career, I&#8217;ve been especially inspired by the way you center kindness, common sense, and acting ethically and equitably in everything you do,</b> from your scholarship and syllabi to the way you conduct your classes. Thank you for everything!!”</p>
<p>Comments from a 2014-18 dissertation advisee: “<b>It’s impossible to overstate Shannon’s skills as a thinker, mentor, and educator. She is a true interdisciplinarian</b>, able to think across fields and draw together resonant constellations of thinkers, artists, professionals around topics both urgent and unexpected (library design and services, repairs manuals, PowerPoint), always with the <b>goal to draw attention to the ways we have collective agency and creative capacity to make and remake our world.</b> Working with Shannon — <b>her consistent, thoughtful, and generous responses to my own ideas; her brilliant edits of my writing; and her example as a scholar and teacher — has made me a more generous thinker, a more active citizen, and a more engaged teacher.&#8221;<br />
</b></p>
<p>Comments from a 2019-21 student: “I can confidently say that Shannon Mattern is the<b> role model anyone would be fortunate to meet.</b> She consistently<b> upheld her standards and fought for what she believed in</b>, all while creating a <b>professional, supportive, and caring environment in academia</b>. She wasn’t just committed to our school but was deeply engaged with various collaborative projects and communities within her wider circle. I watched her with admiration as she excelled in her element. Often, <b>I found myself thinking, ‘If I ever become a teacher, researcher, or mentor, I want to be like her.</b>’ <b>Shannon treated us as colleagues rather than students.</b> She generously shared her personal library whenever we needed additional resources, and <b>through her vast network, we had the opportunity to connect with brilliant and creative researchers from all around the world&#8230;. </b>Her <b>transparency and fairness </b>provided invaluable insight into the realities of our field and helped me understand the expectations for success. But beyond being an academic mentor, Shannon was also a friend —<b> always there to listen, offering us space and security during one of the most uncertain times in recent history</b>. I only wish I could sit with her again for one of our conversations, to witness her excitement for her next project. I feel truly lucky and honored to have worked with, and befriended, Shannon Mattern.”</p>
<p>Comments from from a faculty colleague at another institution: “<b>You have generously shared your pedagogical approaches and resources online and they have helped many of us see creative and interesting possibilities</b> of pedagogy that are rooted in care, <b>not just for students but for the world and the things that make this world lovely.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Comments from a public librarian: “Your approach to interdisciplinary public scholarship has <b>helped me see a path for academic thought that’s truly driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to share ideas</b>. It feels like that should be a given, but it’s really not, and I find it exciting enough I always click through to any new project you’re working on, class website you share, etc. I work in public libraries and that’s how I came to your work. <b>I’ve really benefitted from the way you talk about teaching and look for ways to encourage curiosity and collaboration in your classrooms. I&#8217;ve specifically paid attention to the cultivation of a vibe</b>, setting of expectations, structure of assignments, and shaping the experience through care in materials’ design &amp; aesthetics. Absorbing that over several years has definitely <b>influenced the way I run small seminar/workshop-style programs for adults at my library.</b> I want them engaged, curious, and making connections between ideas, and thinking about educators/creators/etc. who evoke that in me is always my starting point. Given the difference in setting &amp; duration of my time w/ attendees I’m not incorporating specific exercises or readings or assignments, <b>I’m looking more at the way you talk about the class as a living and dynamic entity, the kinds of questions you ask, the space you create for them to make something, and the balance you strike between flexibility &amp; rigor.</b> In a reference context, <b>I’ve also referred potential and current grad students in interdisciplinary fields to your work. </b>Even when their fields were some distance from your own, I’d pulled together a few articles &amp; class websites I felt really underscored that it’s possible to develop a voice strong enough to cut through disciplinary enclosures. Given my lack of access to an academic library &amp; the fact that at least one of these patrons was not yet affiliated either, <b>the public facet of your writing and teaching has been essential to my ability to access it &amp; connect others.</b> I am so grateful, and the people I&#8217;ve shared it with have been as well.&#8221;</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>William Kentridge is among my absolute favorite artists. I try to see everything he shares in New York, and back when I used to blog about all my art excursions, I documented a <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2013/09/22/maps-markings-another-art-roundup-harriet-bart-william-kentridge-nathan-carter-barry-mcgee-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few of</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2014/02/02/aesthetic-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2015/11/29/letters-landscapes-textures-topographies-i-saw-more-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a>. Now, as I enjoy his brilliant <a href="https://mubi.com/en/cast/william-kentridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Self Portrait as a Coffee Pot </em>series</a> on Mubi, I&#8217;m reminded that I had hoped to include a section on his work in <a href="https://transmediale.de/en/media/redaction-disappearing-data-from-nano-to-stratospere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my transmediale talk</a> and <a href="https://www.librarystack.org/reparative-redaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibraryStack booklet</a> about reparative redaction, but we had to cut it — primarily because of copyright restrictions. So, I figured I&#8217;d share that redacted (or, rather, deleted) passage on Kentridge&#8217;s redaction, which draws heavily on Leora Ruth Maltz&#8217;s work, here:</p>

<p>&#8230;Relatedly, South African artist William Kentridge regards his method and medium of erasure as a metaphor for apartheid’s censorship and forced removals, its "fantasies of origins and purity" – and for the nation’s habitual avoidance or “whiting out” of these difficult truths.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a> Yet his chosen drawing medium, charcoal, resists total erasure. It, like Ligon’s oil stick, inevitably leaves a smudge. For Kentridge, that smudge is liberating, perhaps even healing – both for himself and for the fraught legacies he depicts in his work. As art historian Leora Ruth Maltz explains, the smudge’s provisionality “stav[es] off the disabling possibility of perfectionism” and precludes the drawing’s permanence.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> It also signals the “impossibility of a mythic return to origins” and frames erasure – on both paper and land – as futile.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a></p>
<p>Kentridge’s process is a sort of historiographic and geological <em>sous rature</em>. In his Colonial Landscapes series, he aims to “signal the palimpsestic nature of land, to gesture to its ‘hidden’ histories” via red marks that he calls “beacons against forgetting,” which are layered atop the charcoal drawings,” crossing them out, “simultaneously augmenting, qualifying and denying the mark beneath.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a> Again, we see the entanglement of annotation and redaction. Kentridge’s visible deletions “function as gestures of critical distance,” producing what Maltz calls an “epistemology of doubt,” a “radical and productive conviction of uncertainty.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a> These scars link the topography of the page to the South African landscape, suggesting the reparative potential of envisioning the nation as a palimpsest, a smudge, rather than a clean separation of white and black.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Over three years ago, in the summer of 2021, I was asked to submit a chapter to an edited volume that would expand upon an artist collective&#8217;s body of work; they had been engaged in exciting social practice that explored &#8220;the enactment of laws on public surfaces.&#8221; At that time I was thinking a lot about trees: I spent much of the first pandemic year among the trees ringing Manhattan. Those arboreal affiliations shaped the intro and conclusion to <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208053/a-city-is-not-a-computer?srsltid=AfmBOoqOpjy373W-sthSZ4yCCRCLcnDfjazKhBMr-5O--fuqJc9CW7GI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 2021 book</a>, which focused on &#8220;arboreal intelligence&#8221; — which, in turn, inspired a Fall 2021 article, &#8220;<a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/tree-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tree Thinking</a>,&#8221; that examined how trees have historically served as foundational conceptual models.</p>
<p>So, for the edited collection, I wrote about tree law. I did a couple weeks of research and submitted what I thought was a solid, substantial essay. The book would ostensibly be published by an admirable small art press — I own dozens of their books — just a few months later. But we then learned that the project was delayed a few months. Then another few months. Then a year. Then I stopped hearing from the editors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now accepted that that book is never coming to fruition, and I don&#8217;t feel like pitching my essay to other venues. So, I&#8217;ll share it here. I&#8217;ll also note a few relevant incidents that occurred since I wrote the piece: first, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188752528/universal-studios-might-have-invoked-the-wrath-of-californias-tree-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2023 controversy</a> over Universal Studios&#8217; decision to trim their street trees at precisely the same time striking SAG-AFTRA remembers relied on those trees for shade — an incident that sparked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/why-does-the-internet-love-tree-law-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much Internet fascination with tree law</a>; second, the revelation that a man in New Jersey had <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/authorities-say-nj-homeowner-cut-down-32-of-neighbors-trees-the-cost-could-be-huge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut down a few dozen of his neighbor&#8217;s trees</a> to enhance his own views of the sunrise over New York City; and third, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/nyregion/tree-law-mamaroneck-westchester-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this past summer&#8217;s controversy</a> over new tree removal policies in Westchester County.</p>

<h1>Arboreal Codes</h1>
<h3>Trees as Legal and Social Bodies</h3>
<p>Before one could head down to the local assessor’s or county records office, examine a deed, or review a plat to ascertain the boundaries of their own property, they might have instead consulted the trees. Red maples and boxwoods and white pines commonly served as substrates for the codification of territorial claims. Until 1886, surveyors in New South Wales, Australia, were required to use trees to mark the corners of a piece of property. They’d find an appropriately sturdy specimen; cut a blaze into its trunk, exposing the solid wood beneath; then carve in the number of the owner’s allotment.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> If the corner of a plot was signaled with some other object, like a rock or an iron post, surveyors – then and even now – would sometimes use nearby trees to "witness," or point toward, the corner, or to trace the line between those corners. They’d chop a series of horizontal lines into the border trees’ trunks, and those scars would brand the property boundaries for decades to come.</p>

<p>Paint and colored plastic ribbon, or “flagging,” can also serve as less invasive, but also less permanent, arboreal markings. In a timber forest, where the trees themselves are meant to be ephemeral, colored paint and ribbon codes – which vary from region to region, and from timber company to timber company – can flag those trees destined for felling or those spared such a fate, aid in record-keeping for forest inventories, or signal ownership. While forestry organizations have long sought to set standards for such arboreal codes, forester Steve Nix explains, his lot “are an independent breed,” and “many see their tree marking designs and system as their personal or company imprint or brand.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Those marks etched or chopped into bark signaled the identity of those who staked a claim to the tree and the land on which it stood – and, consequently, established social and legal relations between the individuals or parties on either side of the dendrological divide.</p>
<p>As Estonia fell under the control of the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Poles between the 13<sup>th</sup> and 16th centuries, those spatial divides shifted, and the colonizing forces mandated more regimented means of demarcating boundaries. Feudal contracts in the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries and maps from the 17<sup>th</sup> century commonly identified both standing and fallen trees and stumps of all species – oaks, birches, spruces, pines, aspens, and alders – as boundary markers. In the field, those trees were often marked themselves, with stripes or notches, with the bishop’s crozier and lily, or with crosses. When, in the late 17the century, Swedish authorities mandated that landed property boundaries be marked with less morphologically variable emblems, like stones or charcoal pits, the use of boundary trees fell out of favor – yet the cross persisted as an arboreal inscription, now with a new commemorative and spiritual function. Trees had long been central to Estonian folklore, as historian Ülle Tarkianinen explains.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> And starting in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, mourners began cutting crosses into trees as they traveled to burial sites; those marks were meant both to memorialize the dead and to keep them from coming back to haunt the living.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> “In both cases the tree with a cross denoted crossing a kind of boundary,&#8221; Tarkianinen argues: “in the first case, the boundary between earthly possessions, in the second, the boundary between life and death.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>

<p>As these historical and contemporary examples make clear, trees have served as more than mere substrates for legal codification of property. Their markings have also served in accounting and commemoration. Yet those inscriptions aren’t the only means by which trees constitute legal declarations. Through their stature, species, and position, trees also serve as arboreal embodiments of socio-spatial codes. Arthur D. Peterson writes that, in Iowa in the 19<sup>th</sup> century – and likely in other settler colonial territories – the “regular taking of timber could satisfy the requirements of continuous, actual, open and notorious possession necessary to establish title” to a land; in other words, by regularly and openly harvesting trees, one was eventually entitled to claim ownership of that land.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Around the same time, in pre-colonial Kenya, trees often served as boundary markers in customary land tenure practices, which prioritized communal stewardship by <em>mbari</em>, or sub-clans, and distinguished between rights to control land, on the one hand, and rights to use and access it, on the other.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a> Mugumo, “a widely recognized and fast-growing tree with magical qualities,” was commonly used to mark boundaries between clans’ land holdings. The species was not allowed to propagate on its own; only specimens planted intentionally were permitted to grow to maturity. Their presence thus “indicated something of importance such as a githaka (a sub-clan estate) boundary or a ceremonial site.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a> Other species – mwatha, muiri, mukawa, muringa – were also useful in marking boundaries “because they could be easily recognized, because they were easily propagated… and because they had some utility or medicinal value.”</p>
<p>In 1929, after the arrival of British colonizers, the Committee on Land Tenure in Kikuyu Province recommended that only mugumo trees and itoka lilies be used as boundary markers, and that it be made unlawful to plant these species in lines anywhere <em>aside</em> from a boundary. Chief Native Commissioner G. V. Maxwell laid out these recommendations in a set of draft rules, which were never implemented, most likely, forest advisor Peter Dewees proposes, “because they would have legitimized some sort of customary system of private tenure – a notion which the colonial government strongly resisted.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> Validating customary arboreal symbols would have challenged the force of colonial rule. The Registered Land Act of 1963 purported to extinguish rights under customary law and to consolidate the rights of control, access, and use in the landowner. This legislation, Dewees argues, profoundly affected women and the landless, who, under customary law, would have had the right to access and use trees, but lost those rights when they passed to private landowners, typically privileged men.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a> Trees thus came to signal restricted human access to and use of land, as well as use of their arboreal kin within those boundaries. Yet Dewees reports that, in more recent years, state land administration has effectively abandoned the 1963 act and returned to customary distinctions between ownership of the land and of the things growing on it.</p>
<p>Just as colonizers attempted to strip the mugumo of its capacity to encode customary law, U.S. legal historians, again privileging English colonial common law, tend to overlook the capacity for historical “metes and bounds” methods – “systems of demarcation dependent on … movable stones, impermanent trees, and transient neighbors” – to encode localized knowledge and scaffold community relations.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> The network of notched trees was only one component in a larger socio-technical system. As legal scholar Maureen E. Brady explains, colonial American metes and bounds were often “supported by a variety of social and legal practices” that facilitated the enforcement of boundaries and transfer of land; those practices included “the ritual walking of boundaries, legal processes for communal boundary upkeep, and highly regulated land distributions to closed populations,” all of which “helped to reinforce shared understanding of the customized descriptions in deeds” and to cultivate witnesses.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> Perambulation, for instance, involved gathering the community – adults and children – to walk around the relevant property and, while doing so, to strike the boundary line and any boundary markers with branches, sticks, and stones.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> This social peripatetic, ceremonial pedagogy sought to inscribe those boundary lines in participants’ memories – for generations – and to contribute to regular maintenance of boundary markers.</p>
<p>Compared with modern means of demarcating land boundaries, “standardized to facilitate market transactions and yield economic development,” metes and bounds were inefficient. Yet they yielded “thick, customized information … tailored to the specific needs and preferences” of a local community.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a> The arboreal apparatus of metes and bounds “performed important social and legal functions in tying colonists to the land” and to each other, Brady argues, “facilitating compliance with a brand-new system of institutions, and controlling access to outsiders,” which promoted community cohesion and accountability.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a> Standardized maps and deeds, which arrived as populations grew and diversified and as land became more scarce, eventually opened up and regimented those markets – while also disentangling them from the local social fabric.</p>
<p>While the disappearance of metes and bounds and customary land tenure models may have diminished the <em>social</em> aspects of arboreal property demarcation, the trees rooted on those property boundaries – and the commitments and codes informing arboreal care – still interconnect the neighbors and broader communities that enjoy the trees’ shade, beauty, and bounty. “We have a 150+ [year] old oak tree on our property. Its branches cross several property lines,” Lisa Hermsen, a rhetoric scholar, told me on Twitter. “Negotiating how to prune the tree so as not to harm it has been incredibly communal. We all love the tree.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a> Those parties negotiating their shared obligations, she notes, “include the arborist as well as the insurance company and the electric company. And many talks across fences at leisure. Branches do fall,” she acknowledges, and such incidents typically highlight for this cast of stakeholders the tree’s myriad forms of worth: as an enhancer of property values, as a provider of apples and cherries, as camouflage for unsightly utility company equipment, as a home to treehouses and squirrels, as caster of shade for picnics and pontification. In assessing how to address their boundary-tree’s needs, Hermsen says, we’re constantly “balancing [the] interests of the tree and of everyone&#8217;s home and safety.”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>

<p>Such matters aren’t left to informal negotiation. Trees serve as an organic infrastructure for the legal delineation of property boundaries – and the trees that reside within and on those boundaries are then subject to their own laws regarding landowners’ arboreal rights, responsibilities, and liabilities.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a> It was once the case that, if a tree drew nourishment from adjacent properties, the tree belonged jointly to those various landowners.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a> This alimentary model of arboreal custody then shifted to a morphological model – one equating the tree with a particular part of its anatomy. Today, in the U.S. (and perhaps elsewhere, too), the ownership of a tree is typically determined by where the trunk is located; the keeper-of-the-trunk has the right to do whatever they wish with the tree, regardless of whatever comfort or enjoyment it provides to those nearby. Any fruit born by that tree, even if it dangles from branches that hang over the neighbor’s fence, typically belongs to those who steward the tree’s trunk – particularly if those trees have commercial value to the owner, as in an orchard. That said, the neighbor is, in most states, legally permitted to keep <em>fallen </em>fruit, since it likely has little value to the owner, who wouldn’t be able to retrieve it without trespassing anyway. Fallen leaves and twigs, however, are considered a general nuisance without a specific “owner” – which might displease those who live downwind or downhill from a neighbor’s acorn-shedding red oak.</p>
<p>If a storm downs a branch or topples a tree, causing damage to a neighbor’s property, the tree owner can be held liable if the tree was visibly unhealthy or unstable. Such obligations depend in part on where these neighbors live: urban landowners, including municipalities, are commonly expected to inspect their trees for decay and to eliminate any potential dangers, while such obligations are regarded as excessively onerous and impractical for rural residents. In a few jurisdictions, landowners are held liable for “artificial” vegetation they have planted and maintain themselves, but not for “natural” vegetation; such distinctions are often rather shady.</p>
<p>If a tree trunk straddles multiple landowners’ properties, as is the case for Hermsen, the tree is common property, and any alteration to it or distribution of its fruits requires communication and agreement between the joint owners. If a tree is planted squarely within the boundaries of a particular landowner’s yard but the trunk grows into an adjacent property, its ownership depends on the state in which it lives; in some states, the original owner retains ownership, yet in others, the tree becomes common property. If branches or roots encroach on a neighbor’s property, that neighbor, in most areas, is entitled to “self-help” – which might entail cutting any infringing appendages back to the property line, provided such alterations don’t damage the tree. Public utilities, who might be installing new infrastructure or widening roads, also typically have a right and an obligation to remove arboreal obstructions by doing only what is “reasonable and necessary.”</p>
<p>If a neighbor or utility does cause damage to the tree, the owner can sue, and they might be entitled not only to compensatory damages – determined by factoring in the trunk’s volume, the species, and physical condition – as well as “the difference in the fair market value of the property before and after the injury or the cost of restoring the property, whichever is the lesser amount.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a> If the tree is damaged willfully or with malicious intent, the owner could be entitled to treble damages, or three times the amount of the damages. Such calculations operationalize the tree as timber or as impact on property value. Yet the law does sometimes recognize other forms of arboreal value: some jurisdictions allow for the awarding of additional damages to account for the tree’s “intrinsic” value – which encompasses its utilitarian value (e.g., its provision of shade) and ornamental value – as well as its sentimental value or its part of a larger assemblage, as in an orchard or windbreak.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a> Still, as legal scholar Alyse Bertenthal argues, in tree law, “the victim is never the tree, only the owner of that tree…. Although it may have sustained the impact of wrongdoing, the tree remains only a measure of human loss, not the bearer of that loss.”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a> Even Christopher D. Stone, in his classic <em>Should Trees Have Standing?: Law, Morality, and the Environment</em>, from 1972, and those jurists profoundly informed by his work, still mostly frame arboreal rights in anthropocentric terms.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Tree disputes are “never just about the trees,” tree lawyer Barri Bonapart told <em>Atlas Obscura’s </em>Natasha Geiling. “The trees often serve as lightning rods for other issues that are the psychological underpinning of a dispute that people might have with each other.”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a> Arboreal law – both that addressing trees as markers of landed property and as property themselves – is about capital, colonialism, commemoration, the commons, and community. It’s also based on establishing trees themselves as bodies, as ontological beings, that mediate the relations between human and social bodies – from neighbors to nation-states – in space. Does the law conceive of a tree as a mere commodity: something to be transformed into lumber or to enhance the market value of a home? Does the law define a tree’s being based on where it derives its sustenance – that is, where its leaves and roots draw sunlight and nutrients from the sky and soil – or by where its trunk happens to rise from the earth? What about the branches and the roots: when they cross a property line, create obstacles for utility companies, or obscure million-dollar views, they seem suddenly to become ontologically separate from the trunk. And what of the leaves and fruits affixed to those branches? Their essentiality to the tree-as-legal-entity seems to depend on whether their crop is on the branch or on the ground. How, then, do we think about the tree’s other incidental properties and capacities: its provision of shade and shelter for multiple species, its production of oxygen, its consumption of carbon dioxide, its capacity to prevent erosion, its contributions to community wellness? Are these properties not part of the tree’s “intrinsic value,” too?<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Given how expansive and communal are its provisions, it seems absurd to regard the tree as privately possessable property. The lengths to which jurists have gone to reconceptualize the tree – lopping off its roots and branches when they don’t fit the rubrics for legal assessment, framing its value in relation to the real-estate or timber market – attests to the tree’s resistance to such reduction. To then enlist the tree in the work of legitimating a regime that reduces land to property – a colonial system that, as Brenna Bhandar explains, “naturaliz[es] possession and occupation” – ultimately constitutes of reduction of the social world, too. Private property, Bhandar writes, consolidates “language, ways of seeing, and modes of subjectivity that render indigenous and colonized populations,” especially those who do regard the world as possessable, “as outside of history, lacking the requisite cultural practices, habits of thought, and economic organization to be considered as sovereign, rational economic subjects.”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a> Yet as Potawatomi plant ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer argues, it is instead the settler preoccupation with property that is impoverished. “In the settler mind,” land is “real estate, capital, or natural resources. But to our people, it was everything: identity, the connection to our ancestors, the home of our nonhuman kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the source of all that sustained us. Our lands were where our responsibility to the world was enacted, sacred ground. It belonged to itself; it was a gift, not a commodity, so it could never be bought or sold.”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>The trees on that land are all these things, too: they are emblems and embodiments of broader, deeper land politics and social relations. Kimmerer describes how “pecan trees and their kin show a capacity for concerted action, for unity of purpose that transcends the individual trees. They ensure somehow that all stand together and thus survive.”<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a> Settler colonialism instead positions trees, and the land that sustains them, as individuated, parcelable commodities – as points and lines on an atlas of social friction and division. The trees themselves clearly refuse this diminution, stretching their roots, poking their branches, casting their leaves, throwing their shade wherever they please, regardless of who owns the land below.</p>
