<p>I&#8217;m ending an 18.5-year chapter of my career. I&#8217;ve dedicated 40% of my life &#8212; the 27th to the 46th year of my existence &#8212; to a single institution, The New School. In January, I&#8217;ll step into a new position at the University of Pennsylvania, but I&#8217;m hoping that the networks and friendships and shared aspirations we&#8217;ve built at TNS over these past two decades will live on indefinitely.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure most people, after such a prolonged period of monogamous affiliation, would feel a need for closure, reflection, celebration, and release. Yet my desire for these things &#8212; and my sense of obligation to write this post, which I&#8217;ve debated about for months &#8212; is amplified by the fact that these past few years have been <em>really weird. </em>First, the losses, stresses and &#8220;austerity&#8221; of the pandemic era (see <a href="https://www.thenewschoolaaup.org/actions/oct05-press-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>, <a href="https://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2020/10/01/the-new-school-beyond-austerity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>, <a href="https://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2020/11/06/122-staff-laid-off-a-top-down-administration-and-a-corporate-third-party-tns-is-fractured-by-recent-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/12/the-new-school-nssr-austerity-covid-neoliberalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/nyregion/new-school-nyc-endowment-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>) have transformed (and in some cases, <em>severed</em>) folks&#8217; relationships to their institutions, cultivating quite a bit of disillusionment, frustration, and resentment. We lost 20% of our staff in 2020, and many beloved colleagues are <em>still </em>doing jobs once managed by two people. Second, right before the pandemic, in 2019, I moved laterally within The New School to a more &#8220;prestigious&#8221; and isolated division of the university, with the hope of strengthening its connections to the communities I&#8217;d long inhabited. But the transfer, I later realized, wiped out a bunch of institutional memory and social capital, which didn&#8217;t feel so great.</p>
<p>And third: the fact that I&#8217;m on leave for my final semester &#8212; my first sabbatical since Spring 2013 &#8212; means that I&#8217;m expecting more of a quiet fading-away than a marked severance. No send-off party, no &#8220;thanks for your service&#8221; plaque, no &#8220;goodbye and good luck&#8221; form letter from the upper administration (whom I&#8217;ve never met, and who probably don&#8217;t know that I exist). A couple months from now my Google Drive will evaporate. Someday soon, folks writing me at my New School email will get an error message in response. My office, cleared of my books and art supplies and student projects, is already occupied by a visiting scholar.</p>
<p>The old &#8220;Irish goodbye&#8221; is okay by me; we introverts do it all the time at parties! Plus, I don&#8217;t fancy myself a figure of great institutional importance who merits a ceremonial send-off.</p>
<p>Then again, 18 years is a long time. I&#8217;ve given a lot to this institution, and it&#8217;s given a lot to me. <em>Taken </em>a lot, too &#8212; especially these past two years. Honestly, the 2021-22 academic year was the most difficult and dispiriting of my academic career. Certain things happened that devalued 18 years of goodwill and dedication, which I deeply regret. I feel the need to process what happened.</p>
<p>I realize that speaking candidly about the breakdowns and disappointments in one&#8217;s prior work experience can seem ungracious and unprofessional, and can raise concern for one&#8217;s <em>future </em>employers and colleagues. Exposés can make their authors seem resentful, entitled, spiteful, hard to work with. But I&#8217;m pretty sure my students and colleagues would say that I&#8217;m none of those things. Plus, the fact that I&#8217;m continually asked to serve and collaborate &#8212; with students, colleagues, outside institutions &#8212; seems to serve as a testament to my collegiality and commitment to citizenship.</p>
<p>But I do think I need to take stock &#8212; both for my own sanity, and for the sake of transparency. My struggle to process the challenges of the past two years has left a knot in my stomach and a fog in my brain. It&#8217;s impeded my ability to think, to write, to find happiness and purpose in the things that one made me happy. Plus, I think it might be useful to show what the path to tenured full-professorship is like at a &#8220;progressive,&#8221; though still resolutely neoliberal, institution &#8212; for all those junior folks and grad students wondering how it works and whether they want to pursue a similar path.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it just so happens that The New School is currently engaged in its own process of compulsory self-reflection. Thousands of my colleagues <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2022/11/18/headlines/adjunct_professors_at_nycs_new_school_launch_indefinite_strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now on strike</a> to demand a fair contract for our contingent colleagues, and they&#8217;re calling out the institution for the egregious mismatch between its professed &#8212; and widely marketed and compellingly aestheticized &#8212; progressive values, and its conservative and exploitative institutional practices. Contingent instructors make up 87% of The New School&#8217;s faculty; many of them are paid less than half of what their counterparts at other local institutions make; they&#8217;re compensated only for &#8220;contact hours&#8221; in the classroom and not for the multiples of additional hours they spend on course prep and grading and advising; and they&#8217;re often dismissed before they reach a level of seniority that would guarantee them a regular courseload and other benefits.</p>
<p>As the union, ACT-UAW Local 7902, <a href="https://twitter.com/UAW7902/status/1593238846623416320">often notes</a>, their part-time faculty members&#8217; working conditions are our students&#8217; learning conditions. Those part-time working conditions are also <em>full-time</em> faculty and staff working conditions &#8212; because the lucky 13% ends up carrying a pretty heavy service load. I&#8217;ve served on many internal faculty evaluations where the external reviewers express shock and dismay upon seeing the volume of service required at TNS, and by junior faculty in particular. There&#8217;s great disparity &#8212; across divisions, along vectors of gender, race, and class &#8212; in how that obligation and privilege are distributed. My kind and brilliant colleague Julia Foulkes wrote <a href="https://publicseminar.org/essays/reckoning-with-the-new-schools-legacies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a powerful piece</a> last year about these long-standing, hypocritical institutional inequities.</p>
<p>So, in solidarity with the union, I figure now is as good a time as any for a little personal reflection and institutional analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>As a graduate student at NYU, in the late 90s and early aughts, I admired that vibrant, colorful, irreverent, and intimidatingly cool university just a few blocks north of our Washington Square campus. During my final year at NYU (where I always had to supplement my $12K annual stipend), I proposed a course &#8212; the first course of my own design &#8212; for Parsons&#8217; Liberal Studies department, and I was thrilled to be invited to teach a group of fashion designers, architects, and gamers about ideology and design. My interactions with the students, my conversations with various boldly frocked, impressively coiffed administrators, and my years of attendance at various New School public events (the university has long been known for its robust public programming) helped me to realize that one can build an intellectual community that holds scholarship and creative practice in equal regard, that celebrates interdisciplinarity and welcomes willful misfits. I hoped to build my career in such an inclusive environment.</p>
<p>After defending my dissertation in 2002, I moved to Philadelphia for a postdoc at Penn &#8212; a wonderful experience (excepting that one questionable boyfriend). I designed some new courses, advised some fantastic undergraduate theses, won a generous travel grant that allowed for a year of ethnographic work, secured a book contract with Smithsonian Books, and managed to complete my book manuscript and all the image rights clearances.</p>
<p>When I went back on the market two years later, at the end of my fellowship, I applied to a dozen or so academic jobs. Nothing. Nobody requested my work samples or asked for a first-round phone interview. By spring, I had begun to explore non-academic options, but then, near the end of the academic year (TNS is <em>always</em> behind schedule), I saw an ad for a job at The New School: a half-time faculty / half-time advising position in the Department of Media Studies and Film. I applied; interviewed; got the job, miraculously; and received a faxed offer mere days before the job&#8217;s start date. I accepted the offer without negotiation. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think I knew I <em>could </em>negotiate.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to move back to New York, even if my starting salary meant that I&#8217;d be enjoying a lot of oatmeal dinners. I can&#8217;t adequately express my love for this city, and for what a privilege it is to learn from it and teach <em>with</em> and <em>in</em> it. It&#8217;s made me who I am today. I was equally honored to walk each day through those doors at 2 West 13th Street, past a riot of student-designed posters, through throngs of aggressively fashionable undergrads, and catch one of the overcrowded elevators up to our offices on the 12th floor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve occupied seven or eight different offices across my decade and a half at the university. I started off beside the copy machine, in a utility room that&#8217;s readily accessible from a stairway serving the entire building. It was an unsecured and highly trafficked space – one that didn&#8217;t allow me to safely store any personal materials, prevented me from doing any work that required concentration or privacy, and clearly communicated to me my place within the institutional hierarchy. I waited until I went home every night to tackle the course prep and grading for my three classes.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have much time for research in those early years. In fact, I was getting the sense that perhaps I wasn&#8217;t destined for a research career. I remember sitting at my little desk on my 28th birthday. As someone made copies on the Xerox machine that sat just inches from my monitor, I received an email that clearly wasn&#8217;t meant for me: &#8220;how do we tell them?&#8221; it read. The Smithsonian&#8217;s leadership had determined that Smithsonian Books would cease publishing in certain subject areas and would focus primarily on government publications (if I remember correctly). They weren&#8217;t quite sure how to break the news to those of us whose books were in production (mine was <em>in press!</em>) that we would be released from our contracts, yet that accidental cc got the message across pretty clearly. What a birthday surprise! I was <em>so close</em>, and I had no desire to start over.</p>
<p>Plus, I had other, consuming obligations. During my first year I was put in charge of admissions and MA theses (we didn&#8217;t have a PhD program) – work that entailed hosting 10+ annual admissions info sessions, reviewing roughly 400 applications, working with our executive secretary to schedule interviews for all qualified candidates, contacting all top-ranked admits, creating a thesis handbook and a system for archiving theses, overseeing the creation of supervisory committees, and serving as an external reader on all theses and thesis proposals: roughly 60 in my first year. I felt <em>supremely </em>unqualified for all this &#8212; especially as the new kid. Yet I kept reminding myself: this was my sole job offer. I had no choice but to persevere.</p>

<p>My colleagues were, for the most part, kind and supportive. Elizabeth became my lighthouse. She saw the difficulty of my workload and sought to work with me to implement department-wide changes in policy and process &#8212; and to shift my appointment from half-faculty/half-staff to full-time faculty with a five-course teaching load plus additional admin. She also offered me a creative outlet: she and I applied together for an internal grant, which we then applied toward the creation of several courses about media and public space &#8212; and an exhibition featuring student multimedia work exploring the theme. I led a class charged with curating, installing, programming, and administering our exhibition, which took place in a cavernous downtown street-front property loaned by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. The whole experience, <em>intensely</em> labor-intensive though it was, seemed to emblematize the kind of creative and intellectual energy that, for me, defined The New School and the career to which I aspired. I met students in that class who went on to curate shows of their own and who remain friends to this day.</p>
<p>My ability to handle such a daunting workload for my first two years &#8212; while also managing, with the help of my wonderful Smithsonian editor, to find a <em>new </em>publisher for my book (Minnesota), and enduring the peer review process all over again &#8212; led to my appointment, in my third year, at the age of 29, as Director of Graduate Studies in Media Studies. Given the size of the program, the &#8220;directorship&#8221; was really more like a chair or a mini-dean position. I moved downstairs to a new office: a ~100-sq ft room of my own. Barry, director of the undergrad program, and Annie, director of documentary studies, were right down the hall. We shared many frustrations and laughs and late nights. Common suffering forged strong friendships. I made us t-shirts.</p>
<p>During my three-year administrative term, during which I maintained a three-course annual teaching load, I worked really hard to integrate our part-time faculty into decision-making and department life, hosted town halls to solicit student input on curriculum design and school programming, created new modular methods classes, started a student travel grant program, built new interdisciplinary concentrations in sound studies and urban media, established exchanges with various departments in Parsons, and focused on recruitment. Our enrollment grew to an all-time high: over 600 students. Across those years I created some valuable new stuff; I fixed some things; I served thousands of students and dozens of faculty colleagues; I learned how the university worked; I learned to identify the mensches and the obstructionists in each office; I learned what rules are breakable; I figured out how to circumvent dysfunctional systems, and how to find the absurdity and humor in officiousness; and I made some wonderful, lifelong friends.</p>
<p>I also faced and overcame a number of challenges. As a relatively young, third-year junior administrator, I was expected to oversee a faculty of 60+ full- and part-time colleagues, nearly all senior to me, and to interpret and implement a brand-new part-time union contract. What’s more, in my first month on the job I learned that our sole student advisor would be leaving for a PhD program, and shortly after, that our department secretary would be departing for personal reasons. Thus, for much of my first year as director, while I served on (or chaired) the search committees to fill these vacant staff positions, I assumed most of their responsibilities: overseeing independent studies, internships, registration, financial aid, graduation petitions, and international student paperwork, while also handling the administrative details of building our curricula of 100+ annual classes and organizing the new student orientation program. (I was then <em>thrilled </em>to work with Janelle and JJ &#8212; and other amazing department staff &#8212; for the remainder of my career.)</p>
<p>Needless to say, I did a lot of crying that year.</p>
<p>When I stepped down from the directorship, in 2009, I had published the book I wrote during my postdoctoral fellowship &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t a major scholarly contribution, but it was <em>done </em>&#8212; yet I&#8217;d started no new research. I figured I was now on the administrative track, and that I&#8217;d build a career in academic advising or low-level dean-ing &#8212; because that&#8217;s the path I had blazed for myself. But then I inadvertently made a momentous decision: I migrated my seven-year-old Dreamweaver-woven website over to WordPress (shout out to <a href="https://basicmaths.subtraction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic Maths</a>!), and I added a blog. I assumed I had forgotten how to write academic articles, so I started writing 600-word blog posts about course design and hypothetical research projects and my Saturday gallery visits. Teaching was a primary theme. During all those cloudy years, my classes &#8212; and the quirky and curious students who took them &#8212; kept me connected to inquiry and experimentation that provided pleasure and purpose, which I then tried to convey online.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, people <em>actually read </em>those blog posts, which led to speaking and publishing invitations from scholars and practitioners in a wide variety of fields: media scholars, archivists, architects, geographers, librarians, curators, and urbanists actually thought I was interesting! Many of those folks saw the resonances between my pedagogy and my research &#8212; and even acknowledged my teaching <em>as </em>knowledge production. After five years of preparing myself for a life of spreadsheets, my dilettante blog helped open doors to research and creative opportunities. I couldn&#8217;t have been more surprised or grateful.</p>
<p>So, my research started to blossom. I eventually ticked off enough boxes to earn tenure. My teaching stretched to encompass collaborations with, and to draw students from, various programs: jazz, fine art, sociology, urban design, creative technology, politics, etc. That magical heterogeneity inspired me to keep designing ambitious, experimental classes &#8212; and to build connections to faculty colleagues in other departments. Those connections then led to additional invitations to serve on committees and juries and advise thesis projects across various divisions of the university.</p>
<p>There were some semesters during which I served on <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2011/04/22/how-may-i-help-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten or eleven substantive committees</a>; the invitations were typically filtered through the administrations of each division, so our leaders were aware of the obligations each faculty member upheld (they also clearly knew that some of my senior male colleagues were unburdened with such overtures). I especially loved serving as the external member on faculty review or search committees, where I was able to learn about other programs and work intensively with faculty I didn&#8217;t know terribly well. I&#8217;ve made so many wonderful, lasting friendships through search committees. In addition, I commonly served on five or six thesis committees every semester (for some reason, I always thought six was our &#8220;quota&#8221; &#8212; until I learned that some faculty didn&#8217;t advise any projects at all ). I enjoyed this work – I loved meeting people and learning with folks from different fields – but each additional opportunity created a new demand on my time and attention.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of that time in my fourth office, a shared &#8212; but secure! &#8212; space back up on the 13th floor, in a room behind the copy machine. My desk sat by a southwest-facing window, which afforded views of the sunset over New York Harbor. The scenery made all those evening work hours a bit more tolerable. I loved my office-mates, too: I shared the space with three senior men &#8212; all media-makers, all full of amazing stores, and all hilarious. Some of them came to my wedding. All have since retired, but I&#8217;ve kept in touch, and I just saw Peter in Chicago last weekend. I wrote <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2014/01/30/wire-mesh-sunsets-a-tribute-to-my-office-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ode to our office window</a> in 2014, when our department moved into a horrible open-plan space across the street.</p>

<p>Over the years, in addition to my administrative roles, I’ve served on well over 100 faculty committees: search, curriculum, tenure, admissions, and so forth. I’ve worked with the library and communications staff to develop strategies for managing the university’s digital assets. I’ve worked with the university’s curators to enhance pedagogical engagement with the art collection. I’ve served on strategic planning and advisory boards for the Vera List Center for Art and Politics (which I love, love, love!) and other academic programs and initiatives. I’ve co-chaired inter-divisional program development committees, and I&#8217;ve organized or co-organized 15 conferences, speaker series, and exhibitions.</p>
<p><em>All </em>of those experiences were meaningful, but some of them weren&#8217;t materially fruitful. I can&#8217;t tell you how many iterations of the &#8220;media studies strategic planning committee&#8221; I&#8217;ve been appointed to over the years &#8212; each requiring intensive work, each responding to a charge that demonstrates ignorance of, or disregard for, the previous committees&#8217; (in many cases, <em>my</em> previous committees&#8217;) work. Each year we&#8217;d start again, producing a report that we were pretty sure nobody would read.</p>
<p>For six years a Parsons colleague and I served on variously configured committees charged with envisioning a &#8220;praxis-based&#8221; PhD &#8212; an inventively formatted, epistemologically and methodologically inclusive, low-residency PhD that would support multimodal dissertations. In 2014 the Provost charged me with synthesizing those years of committee work; conducting internal interviews and focus groups with faculty, administrators, and students; collaborating with an external research firm to do a comprehensive global scan of all similar design-research PhD programs around the world, and to assess potential stakeholders&#8217; and employers&#8217; interests in such a PhD program at The New School; organizing a planning workshop with those stakeholders; and, finally, developing a formal proposal in accordance with state guidelines. I dedicated a year of hard work; drummed up internal interest and support; produced what I thought was a <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2015/07/29/dissertations-in-the-mist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compelling proposal</a>; and, in the spring, submitted my full draft to the administration, expecting that they&#8217;d work with me to fill in the remaining budgetary and staffing details. Silence. I followed up a week later, a month later, two months later, six months later. Nothing. No response. Not even an acknowledgment of having received the proposal <em>they asked me to write</em>. So disappointing, but so typical.</p>
<p>A couple years later I learned that the university had secured Mellon Foundation funding (<em>don&#8217;t get me started</em> on foundation funding!) for an &#8220;integrative PhD&#8221; program, which involved supplementing a traditional social science PhD with a handful of design classes. The plans emerged out of another division that wasn&#8217;t even aware of the work my colleagues and I had been doing for years prior. Again, a Very Typical New School Experience.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I was recruited to serve on the RPC &#8211; the renewal and promotions committee, or the &#8220;committee for tenure committees,&#8221; for my division. Our job was to ensure that peer review committees and program administrators adhered to a fair and equitable review process. Each fall, we reviewed ten to twelve cases, which involved reading, deliberating over, and writing reports on ten to twelve full dossiers. This was illuminating, important, and rewarding work &#8212; a wonderful opportunity to learn about and appreciate the work of my colleagues, and to ensure that they were being fairly evaluated in accordance with the values central to their work &#8212; but it easily required a hundred-hour commitment each year. &#8220;No one was available&#8221; to relieve me after my first term, so I stayed on for a second.</p>
<p>As I entered my fourth year of RPC service, our school was planning to restructure, and we launched a strategic planning project. I saw it coming: I knew I&#8217;d be invited to chair &#8212; so I told the administration that I could serve on either the RPC <em>or </em>the strategic planning commission, but not both. It came as no surprise to learn in September that I was needed for both, and that our leaders had complete confidence, given my track record, that &#8220;I could handle it.&#8221; I&#8217;d heard that before. We conducted institutional research, held focus groups, distributed surveys. Most of the other committee members were chairs and deans, so I wrote the vast majority of the report and developed our presentation, which we then delivered to the provost and president the morning before Thanksgiving. It was a <em>freaking good </em>presentation, if I may say so. And after delivery, we never heard another word about it. That said, a fellow committee member did later use my text and slides for his job talk when he (successfully) sought a higher-level administrative position. So, I&#8217;m glad our effort wasn&#8217;t for naught! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I had, over the years, been invited to step into various provostial and dean-let positions &#8212; and to lead schools at other universities and research institutes &#8212; but those overtures invariably arrived <em>just as I&#8217;d stepped down </em>from something else, or while I was juggling a dozen other obligations. So, I always declined. Yet I knew I&#8217;d eventually have to &#8220;take my turn&#8221; in upper-middle management. In 2017 I was encouraged to put myself up for promotion to full professor, with the expectation that I&#8217;d then step in as dean of the School of Media Studies. But over the course of the year, while my dossier was under review, it became clear that the ascending chain of deans of provosts saw management and marketing as central to the future direction of the school &#8212; and I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable training the next generation of digital marketers and content strategists. So, I started looking for other pathways.</p>
<p>I had many friends in other divisions of the university, and I knew that the Department of Anthropology in the New School for Social Research had, for a few years, been searching for someone to develop and direct a new graduate program in anthropology and design. I wasn&#8217;t an anthropologist, but I was sufficiently anthropologically-adjacent &#8212; and, just as important, I was a known quantity, a trustworthy figure &#8212; so I was invited to move laterally into this new role. I agreed to postpone my sabbatical for three years (I&#8217;m still kicking myself for this), and I started at NSSR in Spring 2019.</p>
<p>It was right around this time when I learned that roughly half of all women suffer from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157977/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uterine fibroids</a>, despite the fact that most of us never hear about them until we&#8217;re diagnosed. [<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Content Warning: women&#8217;s health discourse forthcoming:] Increasingly frequent episodes of torrential blood loss, which often resulted in rather humiliating public &#8220;accidents,&#8221; eventually drove me to have a few disruptive organs removed. A few months later: COVID arrived! My partner, who&#8217;d endured the grueling demands of New York City law for a quarter-century, joined the Great Resignation and decided that he needed to quit both his job <em>and </em>the city &#8212; so, to accommodate him, we moved up to Hudson, NY, and I learned how to manage a weekly six-hour commute. I eventually grew to love the city-country balance, but those first few months of learning a new routine were, uh, not fun. And I never quite figured out the logistics; the book or rain coat I needed at any given moment was always 115 miles away.</p>

<p>Despite these external interruptions, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning a new field, working with students to build a <a href="https://anthroblog.newschool.org/subject-areas/anthro-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new curriculum</a>, and developing <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/anthropology-design-objects-sites-and-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2021/08/29/design-ethnography-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2021/01/31/mapping-the-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classes</a> to support that curriculum. As always, the students have been an absolute delight, and I&#8217;ve been particularly heartened to see how generously the interdisciplinary AnthroDesign group, drawn from four divisions across the university, supported one another through the pandemic. They liked each other so much they created reading groups and speaker series and exhibitions, and they clearly appreciated any opportunity to celebrate and synthesize their individual skills and realms of expertise.</p>
<p>I would have loved to focus my attention on building the Anthropology + Design program and supporting its students &#8212; but in early Spring 2020, <em>before </em>we new what was about to hit us, I was asked to step in as Director of Undergraduate Studies, too. Thus, by July 2020, I was directing a graduate program that bridged NSSR and Parsons <em>and</em> an undergraduate program that bridged NSSR and Lang; negotiating between competing schedules and protocols across three divisions; attending meetings across divisions; serving students across all three divisions &#8212; all of which was made all the more complicated by the increased intensity and anxiety of pandemic panic and the institution&#8217;s austerity paranoia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the social upheaval of Summer 2020 infused my own department; we had to reckon with legacies of discrimination and bullying. We hosted multiple town hall meetings. Several students reached out to discuss their concerns. We received and responded to multiple open letters. We had long, difficult conversations with our faculty colleagues. We attempted to accommodate student demands and tried to implement a process of restorative justice. Tensions were high (I&#8217;m pretty sure they still are), and managing those tensions required a significant investment of emotion and time.</p>
<p>The global crises that had thrown higher education &#8212; and particularly tuition-driven universities like The New School &#8212; into a tizzy were also impacting families. Students were suffering, and faculty often went out of their way to assist and accommodate. My faculty colleagues and I spoke often about the implications of our institution&#8217;s expectations that we would be infinitely &#8220;flexible&#8221;; such resilience requires a <em>lot </em>of unrecognized, uncompensated, overtime labor.</p>
<p>My family was struggling, too. Social isolation expedited my mom&#8217;s descent into Alzheimer&#8217;s &#8212; and, at the same time, dramatically increased the burdens on my father, her primary caretaker, who was unable to rely on his normal social networks during this period of sequestration. I began making regular trips home &#8212; both to spend time with my mom and to help my dad make plans for her care. During the same week we made the difficult decision that we&#8217;d need to move mom into a secure facility, and that dad would likely have to sell the house to pay for her care, The New School&#8217;s General Counsel received an inquiry about my teaching.</p>
<p>For twenty years I&#8217;ve built <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-access websites for each of my classes</a>; I strive to use public domain material whenever possible, and I maintain that these resources embody the principles of &#8220;fair use.&#8221; The New School has often shared my teaching resources internally and publicly. Various university-level administrators &#8212; both at TNS and elsewhere &#8212; have asked me to lead workshops on course design and course <em>website</em>  design, and to consult with faculty on the value of open educational resources. I&#8217;ve heard from lots of people around the world who&#8217;ve freely made use of my teaching material. Yet in this particular case, when a commercial photographer – someone known to various judges as a &#8220;professional litigant&#8221; – wrote to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9d0.png" alt="🧐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> because I used one of his photos in a single class lesson three years ago, The New School suddenly became unaware of and unaffiliated with my teaching activities &#8212; as if I&#8217;m an independent contractor selling for-profit classes directly through my own personal website.</p>
<p>(I should also note that most students and <em>many</em> faculty, departments, and centers at TNS &#8212; even the university&#8217;s art collection! &#8212; have built their own websites because the university has relatively limited digital infrastructure and no commitment to preserving its digital institution assets* [as many of us have learned the hard way] &#8212; and because the institution&#8217;s marketing &amp; communications teams, the folks who manage the websites, clearly prioritize marketing and recruitment over serving current academic needs or archiving past activity.)</p>
<p>(*N.B.: The small, dedicated library and archives staff is great. This problem seems to be more of an IT/Academic Tech issue.)</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s lawyers passed along the photographer&#8217;s claim, explained that they wouldn&#8217;t be involved, and advised me to secure my own legal representation. Faculty are apparently not a part of &#8220;the institution&#8221; that the institution&#8217;s own lawyers purport to represent &#8212; except, that is, when they&#8217;re charged with sexual harassment and other more egregious cases of negligence. Good to know. I&#8217;ll need to be more evil next time. I expressed my utter bafflement on Twitter, which drew hundreds of notes of concern and offers of assistance (I can&#8217;t possibly convey my gratitude). People expressed shock at the frivolousness of the claim and disappointment in the General Counsel&#8217;s negligence. (I was later informed that these social media rebukes hurt the GC&#8217;s feelings.) Faculty at other universities wrote to tell me about how their own institutional lawyers <em>relish </em>the opportunity to defend academic freedom. Not ours. Colleagues from TNS shared with me stories of their own hard-learned realization that the GC works not to uphold our professed institutional ideals, but to protect the institution <em>from </em>faculty and students when their enactment of those ideals presents a challenge.</p>
<p>Worrying about and managing the case became an additional, nerve-wracking half-time job. Despite my legal advisors&#8217; repeated attempts to contact the GC, they&#8217;ve pretty much ghosted us.</p>
<p>As the pandemic incited the Great Resignation, I repeatedly heard folks warn that &#8220;institutions won&#8217;t love you back.&#8221; I recognized the naivete in assuming that my decades of love <em>for</em> The New School had been adequately reciprocated through boundless collegial and pedagogical love. Still, I couldn&#8217;t believe how quickly the school turned. This was an institution for which I&#8217;d worked <em>double time</em> for 18 years &#8212; all for a salary that, adjusted for cost of living, is today the equivalent of $55K in Albany. A full-professor salary that, as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CbCpd5grsYt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I&#8217;ve come to learn through the AAUP</a>, is tens of thousands <em>less </em>than the average tenured faculty salary at TNS &#8212; a group comprised mostly of presumably-lower-paid associate professors.</p>
<p>I was tremendously fortunate to find two extremely capable (and, in Dan&#8217;s case, <em>kind </em>and funny) lawyers who agreed to represent me pro bono &#8212; but the shock and disappointment in my institution&#8217;s cowardice, and the thought of potentially having to pay two years&#8217; salary because I freely shared educational material that makes transformative use of a single goddamn picture &#8212; a photo of a freaking slot machine, for god&#8217;s sake &#8212; hit me hard. This blow &#8212; layered atop the obligations of overseeing two programs, attending to students&#8217; concerns, dealing with family problems, and enduring that long commute &#8212; sort-of broke my brain. The afternoon after I heard from the GC, I was standing in front of my class when, all of a sudden, the room went silent. I could see my students&#8217; mouths moving, but I couldn&#8217;t hear anything. I forgot everyone&#8217;s names. I didn&#8217;t recognize their faces. They saw the panic on my face. The next day, I had committed to share a virtual keynote with a group of Greek librarians, and I broke down in tears in the middle of it.</p>
<p>I had a series of panic attacks &#8212; my first ever. I didn&#8217;t know they <em>were </em>panic attacks until I started seeing a therapist who told me: yes, you experienced multiple, significant stresses <em>all at the same time!</em> I had chest pains for weeks. I forgot how to write. I canceled a dozen talks and publications. I&#8217;d never before taken a medical leave or asked for any sort of special accommodation from my employer, but now I asked the administration if I could perhaps be relieved of one of my administrative jobs. I was offered a research assistant. I was overwhelmed and miserable. I decided I&#8217;d either find a new job or quit &#8212; as early as December, if possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hoped my brain fog would have cleared by the spring semester &#8212; but by then, I&#8217;d pretty much dissociated from my administrative jobs. I performed the work competently, I tried to serve our graduate teaching fellows, adjunct faculty, and students to the best of my ability, but I decided I would give <em>nothing </em>extra to the institution. I was also so deeply dreading the immanent occasion when my mom would leave home and never return. I went home to help my dad prepare for that day &#8212; and during my visit it became clear that Lily, one of our family&#8217;s dogs, was now suffering from increasingly frequent seizures triggered by a brain tumor. We had to <a href="https://wordsinspace.net/2022/03/02/another-goodbye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say goodbye</a> to our sweet girl the day before my mom walked out her kitchen door for the last time. I wondered: what&#8217;s next? Cancer? A house fire? This year just kept piling it on, and I wondered when it would end.</p>
<p>Miraculously, in the weeks between my converging fall calamities and this spring week of loss, representatives from several universities contacted me to invite me to apply for various senior faculty searches, or to assess my interest in endowed chairs and university professorships. TNS has university professorships, too, which they award to faculty who do interdisciplinary work that bridges various divisions &#8212; kind-of like the work I&#8217;d been doing for years. But the institution has often used the title as a bargaining chip, and as an honor for top admin to distribute at whim, regardless of any potential conflicts of interest &lt;ahem&gt;. TNS didn&#8217;t offer me such a position, but four other universities did &#8212; four universities that seem to be more familiar with my work than my own institution is.</p>
<p>In January I&#8217;ll step into a new role as the Penn Presidential Compact Professor of Media Studies and Art History at the University of Pennsylvania. I&#8217;m thrilled and grateful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also very grateful that I had the prophetic good sense last summer to propose a new Spring 2022 class, &#8220;<a href="https://redesigningacademy.wordsinspace.net/spring2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning the Academy</a>,&#8221; where we would address the challenges facing higher education and imagine how things could be otherwise. What a perfect class to teach during my final semester at TNS! <a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/shannon-mattern-libraries-smart-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As I&#8217;ve said elsewhere</a>, the class became my swan song, my mic drop; I knew I was on my way out, and I wanted to end this era with a mix of cathartic lamentation and hopeful speculation. While, in my ongoing administrative work, I was struggling with faculty who&#8217;d gone AWOL and liaising with their reasonably disgruntled students, my own class gave me one final opportunity to do what I love, and what I think I do well &#8212; that is, to design a creative, interdisciplinary course that celebrates multiple modes of knowledge production, and that facilitates the integration of our diverse students&#8217; complementary insights and experiences. Despite the continuing challenges of hybrid pandemic teaching, our group of students, representing three institutions and at least ten different disciplines, embodied the best of The New School. They reminded me of the ethical commitments and creativity, the generosity and delightful intellectual promiscuity that have characterized my 18 years here &#8212; and which have brought me so. much. joy. My students have consistently been a marvel and a delight. I love their unabashed weirdness and wonder and boundless talent. They&#8217;ve frequently blown my mind and made me cry. It&#8217;s been an honor to know them and learn with them.</p>
<p>Likewise, my faculty and staff colleagues (most of them!) are a dream: so smart and creative, curious and kind, fun and cool. My past three years in NSSR have helped me to recognize how <em>deeply</em> I appreciate the openness and humility (let me say that again: <em>humility</em>) of my Parsons, Lang, and SPE colleagues <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So many of these folks &#8212; brilliant makers and scholars, exceptionally good humans &#8212; have become cherished friends. And soooo many of them, especially my women colleagues in Parsons, have stories <em>very similar to</em>, and even more egregious than, mine.</p>
<p>During the semesters in which I&#8217;ve directed various programs, I&#8217;ve enjoyed taking a day to survey the entire course catalog to create lists of recommended electives &#8212; and I&#8217;ve always effused over the imagination and social consciousness that infuses our courses. I frequently find myself saying: &#8220;this is such a New School class,&#8221; by which I mean: there&#8217;s a distinctive sensibility here, and there&#8217;s no way this course would fly at any other institution. I love that we&#8217;ve created a space for such wonderful anomalies. It&#8217;s that New School sensibility &#8212; the capacity to understand synergies that most other people won&#8217;t get, the ability to see the poetry and politics in the weird &#8212; that drew me here, that&#8217;s made TNS a welcoming intellectual home, that&#8217;s allowed me to become the purposefully and proudly undisciplined scholar that I am today. I owe this dysfunctional institution <em>so much</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful such a place exists. Generations of faculty, staff, and students sustain this beautiful oasis of inclusive noncompliance. I would stay longer if I could, but these past couple years have revealed administrative hypocrisies and cruelties that have done irreparable harm. I hope the university&#8217;s leaders recognize the value and fragility of what their faculty and students have created, as well as the importance of <em>caring </em>for &#8212; rather than merely managing and disciplining &#8212; the people who make it possible.</p>
